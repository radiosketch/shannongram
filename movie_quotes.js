"You're probably not even listening to me right now.",
"Who has the time to type out actual words?",
"And that's where we come in,",

"Which is not as easy as it sounds.",
"Morning, Mrs. D. I see you have the little minis with you.",
"They're so cute.",
"That is so adorable, I can't take it!",

"What kind of business?",
"Monkey business.",
"Meh. That was really good.",

"Why are you laughing, freak?",
"Now, unlike me, my parents are total pros.",
"Gene, please tell me you weren't laughing just now.",
"In public.",
"He was. I remember.",
"Let's go somewhere more private.",

"Anything other than 'meh.'",
"Come on. I don't want to be late.",
"Wait, what?",
"You're just not ready, son.",
"Come on! Working in the cube is an emoji's whole purpose in life.",
"Everybody my age is working on the phone except for me.",
"Sweetie, that's not true.",
"Yeah! I'm gonna work on the phone, and I'm only 10.",
"That's because I believe in you.",
"Should we wash our hands?",
"No, no, no.",
"We're number two!",
"We're number two! We're number two!",
"See?",
"But when I need to, I can be meh.",
"Like everybody else, and then...",
"Then I would finally fit in, you know?",
"You fit in, honey.",
"No, I don't, Mom.",
"But I can change all that if you'd just let me. Just give me a chance.",
"But what if you get sent out on the phone, making the wrong face?",
"No, Dad, I'll make the right face.",
"Look.",
"Meh...",
"You're so handsome when you make that face.",
"Meh.",
"Come on, Dad.",

"Rocket looking to party.",
"Come on, tell me you aren't just a little bit tempted.",
"Steven, for the last time,",
"Come on, man, it's Hi-5. You know me, I'm a favorite.",
"Alex hasn't picked you in weeks.",
"And if he stops picking you, you're no longer a favorite.",
"It's got to be some sort of mistake.",
"Fist Bump. Come on in.",
"Hey.",
"Fist Bump? He's a knucklehead. Literally.",
"Look at him. I can look like that.",
"Cramp. Huge mistake.",
"Help. Help me. Help up the hand.",
"There you go.",
"Thanks, mate.",
"Hey, little Meh, how about you create a distraction,",
"Is someone lost?",
"Smiler, hi. Just leaving.",
"Yeah, you know, just killing time",
"You may not be a favorite anymore,",
"Yeah, in the nosebleeds.",
"The most important thing I can tell you is to just be yourself.",
"Blah.",
"Places, please. Emojis to your cubes.",
"Attention. We've got incoming.",
"Got to be meh. Got to be meh.",
"My gosh, my own cube.",
"And over here could go an inspirational calendar.",
"Okay. Got to be meh. Got to be meh.",
"Look at our son down there.",
"You don't think he'll actually get picked, do you?",
"Hie-ro-gly-phics.",
"Hieroglyphics was an ancient language of picture forms.",
"Does that remind anyone of anything?",
"Hello? A language of pictures. Anyone?",
"Early hieroglyphs date back as far as 3,300...",
"What should I write?",
"Nothing.",
"Words aren't cool.",
"Okay. Be cool. Be cool.",
"All right, Alex is not sure how he wants to play this.",
"Beam me up! Beam me up!",
"Yeah! Thumbs Up is going in!",
"Wait! Alex is changing his mind.",
"He's moving.",
"Okay. Looks like it's gonna be Meh.",
"We are go for Meh.",
"Initiating scan.",
"Okay. You can do this.",
"What is this?",
"Stop the scan!",
"Meh, meh, meh, meh. My goodness, I'm freaking out!",
"What's he doing?",
"He's making the wrong face!",
"Good for him! Little... Wait, what?",
"Be meh! Be meh! Be meh!",
"Abort! Abort!",
"Shut it down! Shut it down!",
"What is that emoji?",
"Wrong emoji sent! Evacuate the Meh cube!",
"Evacuate the cube!",
"Get that bozo out of there!",
"No!",
"My God.",
"The humanity.",
"Medic.",
"Sorry, everybody. That was not what I meant to do.",
"Are you even a Meh at all?",
"Course he is.",
"He's my spitting image.",
"If you have expressions other than meh,",
"Malfunction?",
"No! I can be meh. Just give me one more chance.",
"That's not gonna happen.",
"You know what would be really fun?",
"Where we could figure out what to do with you!",
"What's gonna happen to him?",
"He can't work on the phone.",
"What would Alex think?",
"What do his parents think?",
"Now everybody thinks I'm a malfunction.",
"Even if you are a malfunction, Gene,",
"Let's get you out of here and take you home.",
"One day, all this will blow over,",
"Until then,",
"Wait. You want to hide me away?",
"You're embarrassed of me.",
"It's for your own safety.",
"We're trying to protect you, son.",
"Gene? Where are you going?",
"Gene, no.",
"Sweetie, please.",
"Boy.",
"Order! Order!",
"The motion is carried.",
"So, how'd it go, Gavel?",
"Hey, Light Bulb, tell me what's going on in there.",
"What? Poop, what is it?",
"Tell me, turd. Tell me true. What happened?",
"You're so soft, Poop.",
"Not too soft, I hope.",
"Gene!",
"We were just gonna come looking for you.",
"Why don't you come inside the boardroom,",
"Um, I came up here to defend myself, but you seem pretty happy.",
"So, good news?",
"Right. I'm always happy.",
"Right. Hashtag truth.",
"Well, the only thing that could ever make me unhappy",
"And then our whole world gets wiped out.",
"Smiler, I double-pinky-swear promise to you",
"We know you won't, Gene.",
"We know you won't.",
"You know, the first time you said it,",
"That's because we're setting you up",
"So, they'll like... They'll just... They're gonna fix me?",
"Actually, delete you. But yes!",
"If you get deleted,",
"All right, good talk.",
"Bots!",
"No!",
"Don't let him escape!",
"Party time! Wait a minute...",
"The air is better here.",
"Beer, Tea.",
"Sorry. Sheesh. So edgy.",
"My old cube.",
"Take a hike, Mike.",
"There's AV Bots coming!",
"For me?",
"Just because I'm in the wrong section?",
"Holy deleto!",
"What do we do?",
"Quick! This way!",
"Let's go.",
"Don't tell anyone you're about to see this.",
"They'll never find us down here.",
"Where are we? The basement?",
"No. Welcome to the Loser Lounge,",
"Go fish, Fish Cake With Swirl.",
"Sweep so you won't cry. Sweep so you won't cry.",
"Sweep so you won't cry.",
"Me, Hi-5.",
"Hey. What's up, Hi-5?",
"They weren't trying to delete you. They were trying to delete me.",
"You? What's so important about you",
"They say I'm a malfunction.",
"You bringing malfunctions in here now, Hi-5?",
"For crying out loud, Abandoned Luggage,",
"What Chinese food?",
"Do you have any idea what it's like",
"Here, will you hit my calluses for me?",
"At least you're a working emoji.",
"That's all I ever wanted.",
"Well, if that's all it'll take",
"It's not that complicated.",
"Where would I find a hacker?",
"In the Piracy app. Duh.",
"Who took my clear nail polish?",
"Piracy app?",
"To get there, I mean, I'd have to leave Textopolis.",
"So? I've done it. Would you be a brother?",
"One of the Princess emojis left the phone altogether.",
"Now she lives on the cloud.",
"That is good.",
"The name's Jailbreak.",
"Jailbreak?",
"That's great! Reprogrammed.",
"Help me find that hacker, Hi-5. Will you? Please?",
"Maybe this hacker could help you, too.",
"Like rewrite some code, get you into the favorites section.",
"Wait a minute.",
"Today's your lucky day. Let's roll.",
"Hey, can I come, too?",
"Talk to the hand, Red Wagon.",
"Bye, Felicia.",
"Ciao, Fish Cake with Swirl.",
"Daddy's heading back to the VIPs where he belongs!",
"Wait. What about the Bots?",
"Good point. Good point.",
"Ouch!",
"Hey.",
"You didn't even try to get the tree.",
"It's baffling. Let's go.",
"Hi-5?",
"Hello?",
"Hi-5?",
"Where are you?",
"Gene!",
"Here we are, end of the text app.",
"No way.",
"Come on, Gene. It's perfectly safe.",
"Gene, help me!",
"The wallpaper monster's got me!",
"No! Hold on, hold on!",
"Hi-5!",
"No. This is all my fault! I'm so sorry, Hi-5! I'm...",
"It's one of those rubber finger-monster puppets",
"All right, you coming?",
"What do I do?",
"What do you mean?",
"Just take a step through the other side.",
"This is it.",
"The next time I come back here,",
"Hi-5?",
"No!",
"Are you finished?",
"Where are we?",
"Welcome to the Wallpaper.",
"This place is incredible.",
"Each app is its own unique world.",
"That's my face. You're on my... Thank you.",
"What is this place?",
"WeChat.",
"It's like a whole other world.",
"It is.",
"What are they?",
"They're Bubble Pups. They might be cute, but, man, are they clingy.",
"Whee!",
"They're stickers, Gene.",
"Try to get with the program.",
"This is so cool.",
"Wait. What's in that one?",
"This is what I ate for breakfast.",
"Here's me in the gym! Here's me in the bathroom!",
"Everybody's talking about themselves.",
"How does he know so many people?",
"None of these people know him, but they like him,",
"What you need are fans.",
"They give you complete and unrelenting support.",
"As long as you're on top.",
"Poor Gene. I blame myself.",
"You just wanted a vacation.",
"You take that back, Mel Meh.",
"Bots.",
"If they haven't found Gene by now, he must have skipped town.",
"You mean the Wallpaper?",
"Our boy's on the run.",
"How about we find him ourselves?",
"Yeah, for sure.",
"Tell all Bots to follow those Mehs.",
"Right?",
"Here we are. The Piracy app.",
"This is where we'll find Jailbreak.",
"Um... But this is the Dictionary.",
"That's just what Alex wants his parents to think.",
"This is called a skin.",
"Really? What could a teenage boy",
"Just try to keep up. This place can get a little rough.",
"Ahoy, mateys.",
"Look who's back!",
"Hi-5!",
"Loser!",
"Come on. Follow me.",
"Great. Emojis.",
"Internet trolls. Just ignore them.",
"Eventually, they'll get a job or a girlfriend",
"Virus. We'll just... We'll just walk over this way.",
"Hi! It's so great to see you again.",
"Do I know you?",
"It's Spam. Just sign here and I can get you special discounts on vitamins",
"No, no, no, don't get sucked in.",
"Back off, Spam!",
"It's the only way to deal... Back off!",
"Thank you very much!",
"You can illegally download our CD right here.",
"Hey, Trojan Horse. How are you?",
"Yeah, what'll it be, hand?",
"Maybe with a plate of cheese and hackers?",
"You trying to find a hacker?",
"You can just ask, you know.",
"Sorry. Um, yes.",
"We're looking for a hacker named Jailbreak.",
"Right over there.",
"He looks capable.",
"No, not him. Her.",
"Wait. He's a she?",
"Hey, Jailbreak.",
"Mind if we join you?",
"Yes.",
"That's the thing about the Internet, isn't it?",
"You can never tell if someone's being ironic or sincere.",
"That's a good one.",
"So, here's the thing. My friend Gene here has a little problem.",
"Well, see, I'm supposed to be a Meh,",
"Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
"No, that's good. And we thought",
"Not interested.",
"Hold up. That's not a Meh face.",
"Bots! They're after me!",
"How are you doing that?",
"Look, it's just something I can do. Can you help us?",
"Follow me.",
"Bots! Delete my history!",
"Maybe if there was something to, you know, jog my memory.",
"Come on! Move!",
"Hey, Trolls, why is that mailbox wearing a tuxedo?",
"Hi! It's so great to see you again! Call me!",
"This tunnel will get us out of here.",
"Move!",
"Did that cloud taste sweet to you?!",
"Help me! Help! I'm stuck!",
"Sweet motherboard!",
"Where am I?",
"Get me out of here.",
"Hey, Palm Face.",
"Try getting him out the top!",
"Already on it!",
"Hold tight, Gene.",
"This feels very odd, and it smells.",
"The game obviously thinks you're a candy,",
"What are we gonna do?",
"Stay very still.",
"Don't worry. We've got your back. Right, Hi-5?",
"Hey, Fingers! You want to focus?",
"For your information, I happen to have a sugar addiction,",
"Listen, Finger Head!",
"We have to get Gene out of the game without blowing him up.",
"We have to match up the candies,",
"And we can't match him with any yellows, or else...",
"Don't do that. Please don't do that.",
"Watch.",
"Match three in a row.",
"Don't blow Gene up. Got it.",
"And we have to be very careful.",
"Watch it!",
"Hey!",
"No! No, no, no! Slow down.",
"Not the yellows! Not the yellows.",
"My mom just joined Facebook. Can you believe she wanted to friend me?",
"Hey, Addie, I was just wondering if you are...",
"Tasty.",
"What?",
"Um... Excuse me?",
"Sweet.",
"Hey, Addie!",
"Hi, Nikki.",
"See you later, Alex.",
"Sugar Crush.",
"So over this.",
"Wireless Wireless. How may I help you?",
"It's like this phone is playing games with me.",
"Hey, what does this do?",
"No!",
"Get me out of here!",
"No! Stop it! Stop, stop!",
"It's not working.",
"Well, there's one option left.",
"We line you up with the yellows.",
"But you said not to do that.",
"Special candies get transported to that jar.",
"The game might think you're a special candy.",
"And what if it doesn't think I'm a special candy?",
"Well...",
"Jailbreak, hello? Hello, Jailbreak?",
"Sorry.",
"What if it doesn't think I'm a special candy?",
"Okay, just do it.",
"Gene!",
"Gene?",
"Hey. No!",
"Gene! You're alive!",
"You were trying to see if I had somehow",
"Yes, I was. And you have not.",
"Hey. Looks like something popped up on Alex's calendar.",
"Alex made an appointment at the phone store.",
"No!",
"Calm down, everyone!",
"Calm down.",
"Don't worry. Everything is fine.",
"Maybe Alex just wants to buy some accessories.",
"His appointment is with technical support.",
"Well, I'm sure we still have plenty of time to figure this out.",
"His appointment is for tomorrow.",
"Then maybe it's just for some routine maintenance.",
"Actually, it's to erase the phone.",
"Listen, Gene, I'm about to become your knight in shining armor.",
"You are?",
"Yeah.",
"But first, we need to get uploaded to the cloud.",
"That's where we'll find the source code to reprogram you.",
"The cloud?",
"Isn't that off the phone?",
"Ding, ding, ding, ding. You got it.",
"Yeah, the cloud. Off the phone.",
"We're in Candy Crush, obvs.",
"Of course. Just Dance, then boogie over to Dropbox,",
"Hold up. Here's the stinker.",
"Before they let us into the cloud,",
"The firewall uses face identification.",
"Yeah, the firewall.",
"Which is really annoying, because I've already tried to get through.",
"Guessed wrong once, and now I'm locked out for life.",
"Locked out for life?",
"You're thinking, 'cause I can make different faces,",
"Yeah.",
"You know, women are always coming up with stuff",
"You know what...",
"Well, then let's hit the road.",
"Hi-5, you coming?",
"Why do I always think I'm gonna come around on black licorice?",
"My precious.",
"Hey! Move it!",
"Certain death, here we come.",
"Let's try this one.",
"YouTube?",
"What a visual treat.",
"And I don't even need a remote.",
"That guy is so expressive.",
"He reminds me of Gene.",
"Yeah. Something really wrong with him.",
"Our son is a malfunction,",
"Don't blame me for this, Mel.",
"See?",
"Mary, I think we're being followed.",
"But don't overreact.",
"What are you doing now?",
"They'll be in there for hours.",
"Mary, where are you going?",
"But, Mary...",
"This tunnel will help us avoid the Bots.",
"Thanks for helping us. It's really nice of you.",
"Come on, let's move it. Why so slow?",
"Hi-5, stop. Why are you getting so close? What's with you? Back off.",
"Can't stop now. I'm having a sugar rush!",
"Coming through, Jailbreak! Look out!",
"Hey! Watch it, Knuckle Butt!",
"So, Jailbreak, back there you said I'm helping you.",
"Come on, come on!",
"The faster we get there, the faster I become a favorite!",
"Look at me!",
"What just happened?",
"You don't like it here?",
"There's so many rules here. What is up with that?",
"The cloud is supposed to be amazing.",
"There's so much to see and do.",
"Sugar crash.",
"Catch me, Gene. Catch me!",
"And you can be whoever you want.",
"Thanks.",
"You're free! Come on!",
"My gosh, my hands are sweating.",
"You are a hand!",
"Yeah!",
"You know, come to think of it, I don't really remember",
"Um, you know, you're taking up too much of my brain space.",
"Let's keep the chitchat to a minimum.",
"Someone likes you.",
"What are you talking about?",
"This is just like when Peace Sign gave me just one finger.",
"Let's go!",
"Hi-5, don't do it.",
"Don't you do it. It's already been in there once.",
"Don't do it.",
"Are my fingers getting fat?",
"Okay. We get through this app, and Dropbox is right on the other side.",
"We just need to keep it super DL in here.",
"And no matter what, we can't turn it on.",
"What? I'm a hand. It's a big, red button.",
"What's happening?",
"No, no, no, no, no!",
"Welcome to Just Dance!",
"Follow my moves and you get to move forward.",
"Do the wrong moves and you get an 'X.'",
"Three strikes and you're out.",
"Out? What does she mean by 'Out'?",
"Digital death.",
"Thanks to you, Fingers. Now we're gonna have to dance our way out.",
"Which is all right with me, 'cause I can shake it like Michael.",
"Or Michael's glove, anyway.",
"Are you ready to dance?",
"This is bad, Gene. I can't dance. I got no groove.",
"Come on. Everybody can dance.",
"Not me, okay? I'm really stiff.",
"See? I can't... Don't understand.",
"Okay. No, no...",
"Stop, stop. She has to stop.",
"Ready to dance in three...",
"This I can't do.",
"Two...",
"Dude...",
"Just shut up and...",
"Dance!",
"It's too easy! Hee-hee! Shamone!",
"Jailbreak!",
"Look. Just feel the music.",
"Express yourself.",
"Through dance?",
"Yeah, you got it! Go, girl!",
"Now throw some sauce on that dance burrito.",
"You got it!",
"Great job! You're moving on to free dance!",
"Impress us with your moves to move forward.",
"More dancing?",
"You're killing it, Gene! Slay!",
"Nice! Shake it, Gene. You won't break it.",
"Wait a minute!",
"What's it called?",
"Um... The Emoji Pop?",
"What? You do?",
"Everybody, do the Emoji Pop!",
"Hoo!",
"Yes!",
"Princess.",
"You're the Princess emoji?",
"You never got off the phone.",
"Welcome, new players!",
"What?",
"Who?",
"No!",
"We got to go.",
"Don't worry.",
"They're robots. They can't dance.",
"Downloading funk protocol.",
"Move!",
"Congratulations. You're a disco diva.",
"Hey, Alex, you gonna dance for us?",
"Alex, that's extra homework for you.",
"Hey, Alex, you gonna shake it?",
"No! No, no, no, no, no, no!",
"Alex must be deleting the app.",
"Watch out!",
"We got to get out of here.",
"Come on!",
"This song is my jam.",
"Hi-5, come on! Let's go!",
"Hurry!",
"Hi-5!",
"Gene!",
"Gene...",
"Hi-5!",
"Gene.",
"Hey, wait. Where's Hi-5?",
"Alex trashed the app.",
"And Hi-5 right along with it.",
"Wait, what? Wait, trashed?",
"Hi-5 is in the trash?",
"He wanted to dance.",
"But I knew it was a bad idea.",
"We got to get him out of there.",
"Gene, Dropbox is right here. That's our ticket to the cloud.",
"And the trash is on the other side of the phone.",
"We don't know how many other Bots are out there.",
"No way. We can't go without Hi-5.",
"That's my friend down there.",
"What? What is it?",
"Well, what good is it to be number one",
"Okay.",
"This is why I'm going to get reprogrammed.",
"Well, it's actually kind of cool.",
"Wait, really?",
"You know, I think I know a shortcut.",
"We can take the music streams in Spotify.",
"Let's go give that big hand a hand.",
"Come on.",
"Alex trashed the Just Dance app, and our Bots are offline,",
"Can we please lighten the mood?",
"No one can resist una fiesta!",
"Not that happy.",
"We've only got four hours before Alex's phone appointment.",
"If they find a malfunction on the phone, we are all gonna be wiped.",
"Yeah.",
"She said, 'Wiped.'",
"Aim higher, Steven.",
"The illegal upgrade.",
"Now that makes me happy.",
"Dance, please.",
"Arr! Quiet, you sassy gypsy.",
"Where am I?",
"Hi! It's so great to see you again!",
"You're in the trash, Fingers for Brains.",
"Get away from me, Troll.",
"Hi!",
"It's so great to see you again!",
"You can't.",
"And at the end of the day,",
"No. No, no!",
"This is the last face you will ever see.",
"No!",
"This is Spotify?",
"Yep.",
"Every one of those streams is a different song.",
"Is it safe?",
"Yeah!",
"Are you sure this is a good idea?",
"Fastest way to the trash, dude!",
"Could we at least pick a calmer stream?",
"Okay, buzzkill.",
"Alex. A bunch of people are hitting the promenade.",
"That's perfect!",
"Hey, bubble butt.",
"Yeah, you do.",
"Much better.",
"So, I got to ask.",
"Is it true that when a princess whistles,",
"Hello, stereotype. That is a complete and total myth.",
"Did you realize that on the first emoji set,",
"That's why I need to get to the cloud,",
"Get ready. Whale song coming.",
"From Alex's biology presentation.",
"You're not gonna see that sitting around in a cube.",
"It's funny. You want out of the cube, and I want in.",
"Gene, if that means you can't be yourself, what's the point?",
"You know, I think you're pretty cool just the way you are.",
"We're gonna need this.",
"In the trash? Me? I used to be somebody.",
"Here I am. Look. In an old e-mail Alex never sent.",
"And then there's me, Hi-5,",
"Just leave me, Troll, and let me die",
"Let me look for the world's smallest violin in here,",
"It's the Hand Angel of Mercy. She's finally come for me.",
"Give me your hand!",
"Take my hand, angel.",
"It's me, Gene!",
"Gene?",
"Take me with you.",
"Hi-5!",
"Let go of me.",
"Don't leave me down here!",
"You were wrong, Troll. People do care about me.",
"And I'm not upset, Troll.",
"Do you see how not upset I am?",
"Gene, you came back for me.",
"You saved me.",
"It wasn't just me. Jailbreak helped, too.",
"And she's a hugger. Give her a squeeze.",
"No, no, no.",
"There really is nothing greater",
"You filthy trolls, I inhaled your stench,",
"Now go. Be free!",
"Should be smooth sailing from here.",
"Gene.",
"Gene.",
"Gene?",
"Are you Instagramming?",
"Where is my Gene?",
"Mary.",
"You've really done it this time.",
"No, you haven't.",
"Mel?",
"What are you doing in Alex's trip to France album?",
"None of this is your fault, Mary.",
"It's mine.",
"What do you mean?",
"Is that a tear on your cheek?",
"It's my fault Gene is the way he is.",
"But with Gene going missing and thinking I might have lost you, too...",
"Mel. Why didn't you tell me?",
"Right now, I'm so overwhelmed with passionate feelings for you.",
"Mary, my love for you burns with the intensity",
"Let's go find our son.",
"Together.",
"We'll always have Paris, Mary.",
"So, you're a princess.",
"Is it true when a princess whistles,",
"That's what I said!",
"No, guys! That's a stupid myth!",
"What software version are we living in?",
"Go read an e-book.",
"Educate yourselves.",
"Just look behind you.",
"What the...",
"What is that?",
"Smiler must have upgraded her Bots.",
"Let's get out of here before it...",
"Hi, Gene. Remember me? Smiler.",
"Why don't you come back to Textopolis",
"My friend here will escort you, all right?",
"We're actually gonna delete him in front of everyone.",
"Psst! It's still on!",
"It's still what?",
"Jiminy Sassafras!",
"Move!",
"Separate!",
"Tangle him up!",
"Jailbreak!",
"Gene! This way!",
"It's still after me!",
"Let's go.",
"We have to make it to Dropbox.",
"Yes!",
"No!",
"Go low!",
"Don't worry. It can't get in.",
"It's illegal malware, and this app is secure.",
"Come on.",
"Welcome to Dropbox.",
"You are about to leave the phone.",
"Remain seated, please.",
"You might want to hang on.",
"Why do they call this Dropbox, anyway?",
"This is why! I see that now!",
"Yeah!",
"We made it.",
"Hoo!",
"Guys, guys, chill. We still have to get past that.",
"Holy...",
"Yeah.",
"Hello.",
"Welcome to the firewall.",
"How may I help you?",
"All right, here goes.",
"What do I do?",
"Sit in the corner and don't say a word.",
"Keep those sausage fingers to yourself.",
"Yes, Your Majesty Princess of Nightmares!",
"Now, Gene, step onto the password icon,",
"Okay.",
"Okay. 10-11-2002.",
"Access denied.",
"Okay, try a different expression.",
"Is it gonna blast me every time I mess up?",
"Yeah, kinda.",
"What do you mean, 'Kinda'?",
"Ready?",
"Welcome to the firewall.",
"His favorite food. Chimichangas.",
"Chimichangas?",
"Access denied.",
"This might take a while.",
"Boy.",
"Krav Maga.",
"Krav Maga.",
"Major Lazer.",
"Major Lazer.",
"Abuela Dora!",
"Skate or die.",
"Access denied.",
"Denied.",
"We've tried all the important things in Alex's life.",
"His favorite pet, sport, his favorite grandma.",
"You know, if I had to come up with a password,",
"He's never mentioned a girl.",
"Yes, he has.",
"Hi. When I was in the trash, I read a very interesting e-mail,",
"What e-mail?",
"Sorry, what?",
"What e-mail?",
"To a girl at school.",
"He was declaring his feelings of love for her.",
"Hi-5, this is very important.",
"What is her name?",
"Her name, yes. Excellent question.",
"It was Tina.",
"Karen.",
"Marge. Lindsey.",
"Alison.",
"Sarah or Lupita.",
"Jennifer.",
"Got to find that e-mail.",
"Phillipa.",
"Annabelle.",
"Yes! That's it! Addie!",
"And he used a high five, see?",
"Shade.",
"Guys, should we try this?",
"Addie.",
"Access granted.",
"Snap.",
"This place is amazing.",
"The cloud.",
"One little emoji could sure get lost in a place like this.",
"So, we're gonna... We're gonna do that now?",
"We had a deal.",
"Right?",
"Yeah, okay. Right.",
"We did it, Gene.",
"All our dreams are coming true.",
"Yeah!",
"Yeah, but this all seems kind of super-fast now, though.",
"Doesn't it?",
"Hi-5, I just didn't expect to be having these feelings right now.",
"Well, maybe you should go and express them while you still can.",
"So, I've been... I mean, um...",
"Ever since we...",
"Jailbreak, you're the coolest, most interesting emoji I've ever met.",
"And after all the adventures that we had,",
"If it means I could stay here with you.",
"Like, forever.",
"Forever and ever and ever.",
"Maybe longer than that even.",
"Like in the fairy tales.",
"Like, what is '? Is that a good '?",
"Gene, if this is about you deciding not to be meh,",
"But I had a plan.",
"Right.",
"Gene.",
"You're all meh.",
"The source code worked!",
"Turns out I didn't need it.",
"For the first time in my life, meh is all I feel.",
"No! Gene!",
"Hi. I have an appointment. I'm a little early.",
"No problem. I can take you right now.",
"Jailbreak!",
"Don't do that!",
"That freaky huge Bot has got Gene back inside the phone.",
"What?",
"He left looking more meh than the meh-est meh face I've ever seen.",
"What did you say to him?",
"It's what I didn't say.",
"We've got to go get him.",
"How are we gonna get in there in time before he gets deleted?",
"You tell anyone you saw this, and I'll crack more than those knuckles.",
"Birds do love princesses!",
"It's not a myth.",
"It's not a myth at all!",
"What happened to becoming a favorite?",
"Guess I'd rather have one real friend.",
"And let's go get him.",
"Look at that expression.",
"Is that for realizing you've put all of Textopolis at risk,",
"Hey, that's going too far, even for me.",
"If we can delete this malfunction before his appointment,",
"Any last words?",
"Meh.",
"Well, it's too late for that.",
"Delete him!",
"Wait.",
"You delete Gene, you'll have to delete me, too.",
"Dad?",
"Gosh, I don't know what to do.",
"Yes, I do.",
"Bot!",
"No!",
"Sorry, Mrs. Meh.",
"Smiler, I think you might be making",
"Really? How about you're next?",
"What a touching daddy-son reunion moment.",
"It reminds me of the time I deleted you both.",
"Wait. That's this time!",
"Delete the two malfunctions!",
"No.",
"How's that for an...",
"Great.",
"No! What did you do to my beautiful...",
"My tooth.",
"Hand, button.",
"Jailbreak?",
"Gene.",
"You really are a Meh.",
"What happened to looking out for number one?",
"Being number one doesn't matter",
"Alex's appointment!",
"He's deleting the phone!",
"No, no, no!",
"Show me Alex.",
"Are you sure you want to delete everything?",
"Do it.",
"Red alert! Red alert!",
"Alex, no!",
"Game over.",
"Fellas, I'm afraid this is last call.",
"Dude, Addie's here. You should go over.",
"Every time I try, I screw it up.",
"If we help Alex connect to Addie, maybe he won't delete us.",
"But we'll only have time to send one.",
"Maybe I should go.",
"He has love in his eyes.",
"Send me. Alex looks nervous, too.",
"He's more shy than nervous.",
"Stop!",
"It's Gene.",
"He's all of those things.",
"An emoji should only be one thing.",
"Really?",
"The Princess!",
"Linda!",
"Not now, Mom!",
"Gene, you got this.",
"That's not me anymore.",
"But I have to try.",
"It's starting!",
"No, it's ending!",
"Mom? Dad?",
"No.",
"Last time I was in this cube, I screwed everything up.",
"Gene, why do you think I came back?",
"It's because of you.",
"Me?",
"It's all inside of you, Gene.",
"Just try to bring it back.",
"And do you.",
"Hi-5!",
"It's now or never, Gene.",
"Jailbreak, now!",
"Check out this emoji.",
"No way.",
"Hey, I got your text.",
"That's one super-cool emoji.",
"Yeah. That's me.",
"So, do you think you'd want to...",
"Yes.",
"Hey, excuse me.",
"We made it!",
"Or you, Reggie Ring Finger.",
"Even you, Tiberius Thumb.",
"Change your mind?",
"Yeah, maybe it's weird, but...",
"Gene, you did it!",
"You saved us all!",
"Mel.",
"Gene! Gene!",
"Gene! Gene! Gene!",
"Gene. Gene. Gene.",
"Gene! Gene! Gene! Gene!",
"Gene! Gene! Gene! Gene! Gene! Gene!",
"They love us! And Hi-5!",
"And Hi-5! And Hi-5! And Hi-5!",
"They love both of us!",
"Hey, what up, Gene? Slap me some skin.",
"And a little porridge for the pinkie.",
"Hey, Hi-5, save me a dance for later.",
"As long as you're not all hands again.",
"Back on top of the hand pile.",
"You're not on the list.",
"From now on, everyone is welcome!",
"Wait, what is all this?",
"It's for you, Gene.",
"Everybody, the Emoji Pop!",
"This is jazzy.",
"Yeah.",
"Go, Eggplant! Go, Eggplant! Go, Eggplant!",
"We are out of Alex's pocket, emojis.",
"This is not a butt dial.",
"To your cubes.",
"Good, 'cause we got incoming. Looks like it's gonna be Gene.",
"Hey, Gene, ready to try out your new cube?",
"In three, two...",
"Look Leah, a mushroom.",
"Look what I found - a treasure.",
"It's a magical day!",
"It must mean something - it's buried treasure.",
"We can't leave the box empty. It's bad luck.",
"It's a magical day!",
"Hurry up - we're gonna be late. We're gonna miss the plane.Don't worry the plane's not going to leave without us.",
"Where's Dylan?",
"Where's Dylan?C'mon Leah, we have to go.",
"Leah and I had a fantastic summer together.",
"Leah's father got transferred and they had to move.",
"Hi. Yeah. Are you on your way home?",
"Okay, great. Yeah.",
"No. Nothing. Nothing special.",
"Yeah. Ok.",
"Can you hear me?",
"Dylan? Dylan?",
"What's going on? Talk to me. Dylan!",
"What's going on?",
"Dylan! Talk to me!",
"Dylan, please - What's going on? Dylan, talk to me!",
"Talk to me.",
"Dylan! Dylan.",
"Call 911! Call 911!",
"Is he dead? Is he dead?",
"It's the Rolls Royce that hit him. I saw it - I'm a witness!",
"Is he breathing? Is he okay?",
"Is he okay?",
"Okay, okay. Calm down. I'll be right there.",
"He's in critical condition. Unconscious. And it does not look good.",
"We were on the phone when he was hit. Can he hear me now?",
"No he can't hear you. He's suffered extreme head trauma.",
"My director of Neurology will be here in a minute to see him.",
"He is very weak.",
"Semi-comatose.",
"It's very serious.",
"He isn't my patient but let me know how he's doing and I'll check in on him later",
"Don't stay too long.",
"He needs plenty of rest and quiet.",
"Dr. Rosen? Yes, this is Dr. Ellen. I'm at your patient's bed and he's not here.",
"Did you discharge him?I didn't discharge him - he should be in his bed.",
"What are you doing home? You're supposed to be in a hospital.",
"Help me. Help me.",
"Well he seems to be fine.",
"As a matter of fact he's working at his desk on his next book.",
"Leave me alone I've got work to do.",
"That's it - leave me alone. Do not call me anymore.",
"Of novels! All that's coming to an end now.",
"Can I offer you a drink?",
"No thanks.",
"Are you sure I can't offer you a little drink, huh?",
"No",
"We don't have sex anymore - do you realize that?Where did that come from??",
"It has been months. What's happened?",
"Where did that come from?",
"You're my wife - I want to share that with you. I love you.",
"My office at the bank is having major problems.Anyway... Be quiet - she'll hear you.",
"Oh - You mean your step daughter? Well maybe she should hear this so she doesn't make the same mistake!",
"You bastard!",
"You bastard!",
"Where my pills?",
"Where my pills?",
"Here they are!Thank you!",
"No more. No more.",

"No.",
"Where were you just then?",
"You were mumbling something.",
"You're still not well.",
"Did you take your meds?",
"You were not making progress on your second book.",
"Thank you.",
"You care more about that car than me.",
"You would rather be drunk in here than with me.",
"Right now.",
"Give me more pleasure than you have for the past few months.",
"Screw you!",
"Amy, why don't you and Jim come over for dinner? He could use some company and love to see you.",
"We'd love to come over. We could really use the break.",
"Great - See you then.",
"We're glad to visit.",
"That is amazing.",
"When you were in the hospital you were really bad shape - comatose.",
"Me and the doctors didn't think you were gonna make it.",
"Dinner will be ready soon.",
"It seems like it never happened.",
"Can I have some wine please?",
"How's school?",
"Almost done.",
"But I have this really interesting project about elephants in Africa.",
"Can I be excused?",
"About all this national and international corruption I know is going on.",
"Can we talk now please?",
"He stopped taking his meds.",
"Can you get some for me?",
"You had confidence.",
"But now you're sliding backwards.",
"Why do you keep saying that?Why?I know I have issues.",
"Aren't our sessions rewarding anymore?",
"No",
"We've gone through the good times and the bad times together!",
"Your pill taking for pain relief has gotten out of control.",
"But it's my choice.It's the wrong choice.",
"No - no rehab.",
"My job sucks!",
"It's going to shock the world. I've hacked into just about all the information I need.",
"They have no idea. It's going to change the world as we know it. It's going to change everything.",
"They have no idea.",
"The bank is failing. Pills help.",
"It's a crutch! Get off the pills! Straighten your life out!",
"Maybe it's because of you...",
"What?! I've been so supportive of you!",
"So supportive.",
"You heard what I said.",
"You're not the same girl!",
"She's not coming back.",
"Don't turn away. Let's talk!",
"Really?",
"Even during the writing of your first book",
"You were given a power. It's in the wind. Be careful.",
"They will harm you.",
"You know? About it?",
"How do you know?",
"They want what you have.",
"It was meant for you.",
"It's yours forever now.",
"You didn't let me down.",
"Let's try and start over.",
"We both got problems.",
"Fine!",
"You go!",
"It's late. Come to bed. You need to sleep.",
"But I need you to go away now.",
"Are you having an affair?",
"That's it, isn't it?",
"You are, aren't you?",
"No, I'm not having an affair.",
"Don't be ridiculous.",
"There is another girl.",
"No that is not true.",
"And I'm going to expose them all.",
"And no one knows I'm doing it.",
"No one...",
"What?!",
"Are you crazy?",
"That's dangerous!",
"Don't tell anyone.",
"Don't tell anyone.",
"Let's invite Jim and family for a nice, quiet, peaceful barbecue at the pool.",

"Amy?",
"Hi. [laughs]",

"Hey",
"Was that Aly? What is she doing in here?",
"You should know - you're the one who invited her over here.",
"Then I find her taking a bubble bath in our tub.",
"Good.",
"What, another hard day at the office?",
"Dammit - yes, as a matter of fact.",
"Have you seen Ali?",
"Let me tell you about Aly.",
"Aly's been sneaking over to Dylan and Emily's house",
"And jumping in their swimming pool.",

"Jim!",

"Goodbye, my friend.",
"Goodbye.",
"What?!",
"Suicide?!",
"How could Jim have killed himself?",
"How could he have committed suicide?",
"Emily,you know I'm here for you.",
"Anything to help you.",
"Jim's suicide was not your fault.",
"You can't blame yourself.",
"It was not your fault.",
"Over the edge.",
"He wasn't a bad person.",
"It's all my fault",
"Coupled with the problems we have between us.",
"At home.",
"It hurts me to see you this way.",
"It's not what I wanted.",
"You're better off without me.",
"No.",
"No, don't say that.Don't say that.Please don't say that.",
"Hello.",
"What deadline?",
"No I'm not - You know what?",
"After giving it some thought, I am not going to sign the book deal with you.",
"No, I'm not signing the contract.",
"None!",
"You never gave me a retainer. I never asked for one.",
"No book.",
"That first book made a fortune for you.",
"And I don't owe you anything.",
"That's it",
"Don't call here anymore.",
"No more damn books!",
"No more books!",
"She was beautiful.",
"She was my love.",
"She is still with you.",
"In your heart.",
"She knows you're thinking of her spirit.",
"Tell me about your dream.",
"Is it her?",
"We can increase your dosage if you want to.",
"You do want to?",
"You do, don't you?",
"No. No I can't.",
"This dream you're having.",
"What is it? Are you really writing a book?",
"Or is it something else?",
"Tell me!",
"Our sessions have filled the void in your life...",
"Yes.",
"Oh, by the way -",
"Are you seeing another therapist now?",
"No no no no",
"There is no one else. I am not seeing any other therapist.",
"There are no other therapists.",
"How is your, uh",

"Is there anything else you can tell me about them?",
"Dylan's research.",
"Great to see you.You too.",
"The engagement's off.",
"Shhh - no. It's better this way.",
"Besides, there was always someone else anyway.",
"Ever since I was a kid.",
"And finding a black cube.",
"And I love you.",
"It was magic.",
"It was a true childhood love story.",
"You're everything I've ever wanted.",
"It's magical day.",
"It's a magical time.",
"Emily! Emily!",
"Emily!",
"Emily!",
"Wake up. Wake up.",
"Emily.",
"Emily.",
"It was you.",
"Emily's dead.",
"Deeper than the first book.",
"No.",
"It's not a book.",
"It's research.",
"Research that will make a strong significant difference.",
"To people all over the country.",
"There should be no void in your life.",
"Keep a clear mind and soul.",
"Don't let the outside world poison your spirit.",
"To inspire you.",
"To give you strength for this one important act for humanity.",
"All this time I haven't been working on my next book.",
"The most secret.",
"And discovered corporate and government...",
"Much more than has ever been seen before.",
"These documents are going to change the world.",
"You're going to get yourself killed.",
"Someone's going to find out.",
"They're gonna come after you.",
"No one knows.",
"But I think you're right.",
"Others have found out what I'm doing.",
"Leah - Hi, it's Dylan. I just pulled into the driveway and I'm",
"Leah!",
"Leah are you there?! Leah, pick up!",
"Leah where are you?",
"Your purse is here laying on the walkway leading up to the front door.",
"Leah where are you? Pick up! Are you okay? Are you okay Leah??",
"Leah, where are you? I'm worried.",

"Give me the key!I DON'T HAVE -",
"Leah",
"Leah",
"It's Dylan.",

"So glad I found you. Everything's going to be okay. Don't worryabout anything. I'm going to get you out of here.",
"Who are these people?I... don't know who they are.",
"Let me untie you.",
"Don't worry. I won't let anything happen to you.",
"It's okay.What do they want?Trust me. Trust me. I don't know. We're going to get out of here right now.",
"But- I need to put the blindfold back on. Trust me. Trust me.",
"We're going to get out of here but you can't see what's about to happen.",
"Everything's going to be okay.",
"Let's go.",
"What's happening?I'll tell you later.",
"Let's go.",
"You cannot come here again.",
"But I thought you liked when I came here.",
"No I don't like it. You've got to go.",
"Go now.",
"You cannot come here.",
"The police are at my house.",
"Talking to my mom...about my dad's death",
"You know he didn't kill himself. She shot him. She killed him. I saw her.",
"What?",
"She planted the gun on hiim to make it look like a suicide.",
"You have got to go to the police.",
"Now!",
"Leah. Hi, this is Dylan. I just got out of bed.",
"Should I be afraid?",
"Should we be afraid?",
"Good morning.",
"What are these? Where'd they come from?",
"Nothing's going to happen to him.",
"All over the world.",
"Ever!",
"What I have found will shock you.",
"Here are the files and supporting documents.",
"And supporting truths.",
"The factual documents.",
"Money, pay-offs, and greed were always the priority of my company, like many companies.",
"They now know my crimes.",
"And the country.",
"Many of my other fellow incompetent senators",
"Must resign now also.",
"My releasing these files today will not endanger any innocent persons.",
"But they will identify governments and corporations that have committed fraudulent and criminal activities against mankind.",
"These people must be punished. And eliminated - immediately!",
"For their lying, their greed, their injustices!",
"We were all under pressure to operate in a deceiving way.",
"And cheat the customer.",
"Goodbye.",
"Today I am submitting my resignation as congresswoman.",
"The people deserve much better!",
"Are crimes are about to be disclosed.",
"Lying, cheating, of our customers, fraud.",
"Me and many of my fellow Wall Street brokers",
"We cannot continue to let them slip through our failed justice systems.",
"These files will prove to all of you - all of you -the political and corporate dishonesty that exists.",
"There're systems that are there to undermine societies best interests",
"You will be shocked and amazed at what I have here.[gunshot]",
"It will scare you.",
"But you should be scared be because it is the truth!",
"You now have all the truths. The real truth!",
"Act now - on your own!",
"Act now!",
"It's our only hope for the future.",

"Then we slowly:",
"Darkness, with a small shape in the center of the screen.                As MAIN TITLES CONTINUE OVER, CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN on                the shape.",
"We get closer and closer until we see that the shape is a                Halloween mask. It is a large, full-head platex rubber                mask, not a monster or ghoul, but the pale, neutral features                of a man weirdly distorted by the rubber. .",
"Finally CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on the eye of the mask. It                is blank, empty, a dark, staring socket.. SUPERIMPOSE FINAL",
"Black screen.  SUPERIMPOSE:",
"It is night. We move toward the rear of a house through                Someone's POV. CAMERA MOVES UP to a Jack-o'-lantern glowing                brightly on a windowsill. It is a windy night and the                curtains around the Jack-o'-lantern ruffle back and forth.",
"Suddenly we hear voices from inside the house.",
"Then LAUGHTER.",
"The POV moves from the Jack-o'-lantern down to another                window and peers inside. We see the sister's bedroom through                the blowing curtains.",
"Into the bedroom comes the SISTER, 18, very pretty. She                GIGGLES as the BOYFRIEND jumps into the room. Also 18, he                wears a Halloween mask and costume.",
"The boyfriend grabs the sister and kisses her.",
"The boyfriend rips off his mask. He is a handsome young                man underneath. They kiss again, this time with more                passion. The boyfriend begins to unbutton the sister's                blouse. She responds to him.",
"The POV swings away from the window and begins to restlessly                pace back and forth, agitated, disturbed. We HEAR THE SOUNDS                of the sister and boyfriend inside the bedroom growing                more and more passionate.",
"Finally the POV moves back up to the window. Inside through                the moving curtains, we see the sister and the boyfriend                on the bed, naked, making love.",
"The POV springs back from the window and stalks quickly                down the side of the house, past the Jack-o'-lantern, around                to a door. Quietly the door is opened and the POV moves                inside.",
"The POV glides silently through the house into the kitchen,                up to a drawer. The drawer is opened. A large butcher knife                is withdrawn.",
"Then the POV swings around and moves to the kitchen door.                We look down a hallway to the front door. The boyfriend                steps out of the bedroom door, buttoning his shirt. The                sister stands in the doorway, a sheet wrapped around her.",
"They kiss again and the boyfriend walks to the front door.                 The sister watches as he leaves and shuts the door behind                him. Then she turns and steps back into the bedroom.",
"The POV moves slowly down the hall to the bedroom door and                peers around inside. The sister sits at her night-table                brushing her hair. She is still completely nude.",
"Slowly the POV moves into the room. Suddenly we move down                to the discarded Halloween mask on the floor. The POV bends                down and picks it up. Then suddenly the POV is covered by                the mask and we see through the eye-holes.",
"The POV moves up behind the sister. Sensing a presence,                she spins around and stares at the POV, covering her breasts                quickly.",
"Suddenly the POV lunges forward. The sister continues to                stare incredulously. There is a rapid blur as the POV drives                the butcher knife into the sister's chest and out again                almost before we've seen it.",
"The sister looks down at the blood forming at her hands,                then",
"Then in a wild paroxysm the butcher knife blurs continuously                in and out of frame, slashing the sister mercilessly. She                begins to SCREAM, trying to fend off the blows with her                hands, then suddenly falls out of frame to the floor.",
"The POV moves back away from the sister's lifeless body,                spins around and careens out of the bedroom.",
"At top speed the POV races through the darkened house, to                the front door, out the door, down the steps and rapidly                up the street. The CAMERA careens along in frenzied flight,                up the sidewalk, up a small side alley, down someone's                backyard, then to a sudden, abrupt halt in front of MOTHER                and FATHER just coming out of a neighbor's house.",
"Mother and Father stare at the POV, at first in puzzlement,                then slow, growing horror.",
"The father's hand reaches up and rips off the Halloween                mask, revealing MICHAEL, 6, underneath, a bright-eyed boy                with a calm, quiet smile on his face. CAMERA PULLS BACK,                revealing the blood-stained butcher knife in his hand,                then further back, CRANING UP past his parents standing                there, up from the neighbor's house to a HIGH SHOT of the                neighborhood as the sounds of POLICE SIRENS rise in the                distance.",
"Two headlights appear in the darkness, backlighting the                rain that pours down on a lonely strip of highway. A station                wagon HISSES along the wet road surface.",
"The back seat is separated from the front by a wire-mesh                screen, much like a police car. MARION, 30, drives. She is                dressed in a crisp, white nurse's uniform. Next to her in                the passenger seat is SAM LOOMIS, a clinical psychiatrist.                He is a tough-looking man in his forties who flips through                pages in a manila folder.",
"Through the rain we see a large sign:",
"Behind the sign is the sanitarium itself, a cold-looking                building surrounded by a fence.",
"Loomis glances at Marion as she lights a cigarette. She                shoves the matches into the pack and tosses it on the                dashboard. Loomis stares at the cigarette pack. The pack                of matches reads: 'The Rabbit in Red Lounge -- Entertainment                Nightly.' Loomis turns his eyes back to the rain-slicked                road.",
"Both of them suddenly stare out the windshield in front of                them.",
"Through the rain we see a field off to the side of the                road. Dimly lit by the car headlights are FIVE PATIENTS,                dressed in wind-blown white gowns, drenched by the rain,                wandering aimlessly around the field.",
"They look up ahead.",
"Standing by the side of the road is a MALE PATIENT, a wild-               looking man in his sixties dressed in a white gown, who                stares at the station wagon.",
"Marion slows the station wagon and pulls off to the side                of the road. Loomis jumps out.",
"Through the windshield we see Loomis rush over to the                patient, stand and talk for a moment, then hurry back.",
"Loomis climbs back in, dripping from the rain.",
"Marion starts down the road.",
"Ahead of them is the entrance to the sanitarium.",
"Marion slows down to turn.",
"Through the rear window we see a SHAPE spring up out of                the darkness, streak through the rain and leap up on the                rear of the station wagon.",
"The station wagon bounces up and down. The roof sags in                and out with the weight of someone on top.",
"The roof continues to buckle in and out wildly.",
"Marion stops and rolls down her window to look outside.",
"Loomis opens his door and steps out. Suddenly he is hit in                the face by a powerful fist from the roof. Loomis staggers                backwards and falls by the side of the road.",
"Marion starts to react. Suddenly a hand reaches in through                the window and lunges at her.",
"The fingers grab her hair. She SCREAMS. The fingers tighten                around her hair and the hand pulls Marion roughly to the                window.",
"Twisted around in the seat, Marion's foot jams down all                the way on the gas pedal. The station wagon ROARS forward.",
"Marion continues to SCREAM, clawing at the hand.",
"Through the rain the road spins crazily ahead, the wipers                erasing sheets of rain.",
"Suddenly the other hand reaches down from the roof and                grabs the wiper, holding it tightly. Rain splashes on the                windshield obscuring the road.",
"The hand rips at Marion's hair. SCREAMING. Clawing.",
"The windshield is completely obliterated by rain.",
"The station wagon skids and WHAMS into the shoulder on the                Side of the road. Marion is hurled across the seat against                the passenger door.",
"Suddenly the hand springs down from above and SLAMS against                the passenger window, shattering it.",
"Marion frantically crawls her way across the rain-drenched                road away from the station wagon. CAMERA TRACKS with her                as she slides down into the muddy shoulder. She looks back.",
"From the shoulder we see the station wagon in the rain,                and the shape jump in the driver's seat and SLAM the door.",
"Then the station wagon takes off and disappears down the                road into the darkness.",
"Loomis runs up out of the rain and helps Marion to her                feet.  She CRIES hysterically. Loomis stares off down the                road at the disappearing taillights.",
"He catches up with her and they walk along down the street.",
"They walk up to the front of the old, two-story Myers house                set back from the street. It is now weather-beaten and                dilapidated. Laurie walks through the front gate and starts                up toward the porch.",
"Laurie holds up a key.",
"Laurie strolls up to the front porch. She bends down, lifts                the welcome mat and places the key under it.",
"Through a front window, we see Laurie bending over the                welcome mat. Suddenly a dark shape, the outline of a man,                leans forward, watching her. As she walks back to Tommy at                the street the shape moves to watch them, then fades back                into the interior of the house.",
"Laurie and Tommy continue walking down the street.",
"Tommy breaks stride and runs across the street.",
"Laurie continues walking alone. She begins to sing quietly                to herself.",
"We see Laurie walking off down the street in the distance.                 CLOSE TO CAMERA the dark shape moves into frame, watching                Laurie disappear around the corner.",
"Sam Loomis strides quickly out of the front of the                sanitarium followed immediately by DR. WYNN, a gray-haired                man in his forties. CAMERA TRACKS with them across the                parking lot.",
"Loomis reaches a car and unlocks it.",
"Loomis gets in the car. Wynn leans down to the window.",
"Loomis starts up the car and pulls away from the sanitarium.",
"Wynn watches him go, then hurries back into the building.",
"Laurie sits at the back of a classroom of HIGH SCHOOL                STUDENTS. CAMERA MOVES IN on her as a TEACHER drones away                at the front of the room.",
"Laurie lets her gaze move to a window. She stares dreamily                outside.",
"From the window she can see the street, and a station wagon                parked along the sidewalk.",
"Behind the station wagon stands the shape of a man. We                can't quite see his features from here, but it is clear                that he is looking in the school window.",
"She turns away from the window and begins to doodle again.",
"We see Laurie draw:",
"She glances up from the book and out the window again.",
"The shape behind the station wagon is still there and                staring right at her.",
"She frowns, staring back at the shape.",
"This springs her around from the window.",
"Laurie sneaks a glance back to the window.",
"The shape and the station wagon are gone.",
"She turns back from the window and back to her notebook.",
"She has written:",
"We see a car parked in front of a small, closed-down gas                station/diner by the side of the highway. CAMERA SLOWLY                TRACKS over to a phone booth. Loomis is inside on the                telephone.",
"Loomis hangs up the phone and steps out of the booth. He                looks up the highway.",
"The highway disappears off into the distance. There is an                old weather-beaten sign that reads:",
"Just above the horizon huge clusters of clouds, dark and                ominous, are blown along by the wind.",
"Loomis turns and walks back to his car. He glances at the                old gas station as he walks.",
"The building is dark, empty, dilapidated. On the padlocked                door are huge marks like the clawing of an animal wanting                to get in.",
"Loomis stops, stares at the door and then slowly walks                over to it. He touches the marks with his hands, then looks                at the dirt driveway around the building.",
"There are definite tire tracks leading from the highway up                to the door, then back to the highway again.",
"Then his gaze returns to a discarded object crushed in the                dirt of the driveway: a pack of cigarettes.",
"He picks up the cigarette pack.",
"Stuck in the cellophane of the crushed pack are matches:",
"Loomis turns and quickly strides back to his car, gets in                and roars away from the lonely gas station.",
"The playground is filled with CHILDREN just getting out of                school for the day. Some are dressed in Halloween costumes,                some carry pumpkins and orange and black streamers, some                carry Jack-o'-lanterns.",
"Tommy Doyle comes out of the door carrying a very large                pumpkin. He is followed by 3 BOYS, RICHIE, KEITH and LONNIE,                who are LAUGHING and pushing him.",
"Lonnie runs up to Tommy and wiggles his fingers in Tommy's                face. The other boys form a circle around Tommy and taunt                him. In unison they sing:",
"The boys LAUGH. Richie runs up to Tommy and makes a face.",
"The other boys join in the chant.",
"Tommy turns from them and starts to run away. Richie sticks                out his foot. Tommy trips and falls to the concrete,                SMASHING his pumpkin beneath him. The other boys run away                GIGGLING and SCREAMING with delight.",
"As the boys race out of the playground, Richie barrels                through the gate and runs right into the dark shape.",
"We don't see the shape's face, just his lower body. He is                dressed in pants and a shirt that look too big for him. He                grabs Richie and holds him back at arm's length.",
"The shape lifts his foot. Underneath it is a large butcher                knife. He quickly picks it up and shoves it into his pocket.",
"Slowly the shape turns and walks away from the playground                gate, CAMERA TRACKING WITH HIM. Across from him in the                playground we see Tommy get to his feet, wiping the                demolished pumpkin off his shirt and pants.",
"We TRACK WITH THE shape to a station wagon. On the side of                the door is a state emblem.",
"The shape gets in the station wagon. We still don't see                his face. Separating the front and back seats is the wire-               mesh screen. It is Loomis' vehicle. The shape starts the                engine. He pulls away from the curb.",
"Slowly the station wagon moves down the street. We see                Tommy hurrying along the sidewalk, still rubbing off the                pumpkin splatter. Tommy turns off the sidewalk and cuts up                a side alley.",
"The wagon picks up speed and continues on down the street.",
"Laurie and LYNDA stroll down the front steps of the high                school and turn up the street. Laurie carries another large                stack of books. Lynda is a knockout in tight jeans and                tight T-shirt. She carries no books. CAMERA TRACKS WITH                THEM up the street.",
"The girls stop and wait for Annie.",
"Laurie suddenly stops and turns back toward the school.",
"Laurie glances down the street.",
"The station wagon slowly moves up the street toward them.                The shape isn't visible behind the windshield.",
"Laurie stares at the station wagon as it moves past. She                looks directly at the shape inside. There is a quick glimpse                of him, a strange pale face staring back.",
"The shape is close to CAMERA, out of focus. Out the window                we see the three girls on the sidewalk.",
"The shape stares at Laurie looking back at him, then tromps                on the accelerator. The wagon whizzes past them.",
"Up the street the wagon suddenly stops. It sits there,                waiting.",
"For a moment the station wagon just sits there. Then it                takes off down the street and disappears around a corner.",
"The girls start walking again. Laurie is quiet, puzzled by                the appearance of the man in the car.",
"Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw or talk to you.",
"The three girls stop in front of Lynda's house, a modest                suburban home on a quiet, tree-lined street.",
"Lynda strolls up to her house. Annie and Laurie start down                the street. CAMERA MOVES IN to a CLOSE SHOT of Laurie's                face. She stares ahead along the sidewalk.",
"Up the sidewalk is a series of bushes lining the street.                 There, partially hidden in the shadows of a bush, is the                shape of a man, watching them. He is barely visible, almost                blending in with the dark foliage.",
"The shape is gone. Just bushes.",
"Annie walks right over to the bushes and kicks them hard.",
"Nothing happens.",
"Laurie just stands on the sidewalk several feet from the                bushes.",
"Slowly Laurie walks over and stares at the bush.",
"They start walking down the sidewalk again.",
"You must have a small fortune stashed from baby-sitting so                much.",
"Laurie glances back at the bushes behind them.",
"You're seeing men behind bushes.",
"The two girls stop in front of Annie's house, another small                suburban home.",
"Annie walks up to her door.",
"For a moment Laurie looks around cautiously before starting                down the sidewalk again, CAMERA TRACKING WITH HER. A strong                wind rises and blows her hair in front of her face. Again                she turns around and glances back down the street.",
"There is still nothing there.",
"Suddenly, Laurie walks right into a man standing on the                sidewalk in front of her. She SCREAMS and drops her books.",
"It is LEE BRACKETT, Annie's father. He is a tall man in a                county sheriff's uniform. He quickly bends down and picks                up her books.",
"Brackett walks down the sidewalk to his house. Laurie                bundles her books and hurries up the street.",
"Laurie walks up on the front porch of her house. She pauses                a moment and glances down the street.",
"Several CHILDREN in costumes are going door to door                collecting their treats.",
"Laurie strolls through the living room. Through the doorway                into the kitchen we see LAURIE'S MOTHER busy making candied                apples.",
"Laurie walks into her bedroom. She tosses her books on the                bed and starts to her telephone.The wind blows her curtains                through the open window. Laurie crosses to the window and                leans up to close it.",
"From her room in the second story, Laurie can see into the                backyard next door.",
"There is a clothesline with sheets blowing in the wind. In                between the sheets we glimpse the shape standing there,                looking up at Laurie.",
"She freezes and stares down fearfully.",
"The sheets continue to twist and turn in the wind, but now                the shape is gone.",
"Laurie SLAMS the window and locks it. She slowly walks to                the middle of her room and stands there for several moments,                unsure as to whether she has actually seen it.",
"Suddenly, the phone RINGS, loud and shrill, startling                Laurie.",
"She answers it.",
"Silence.",
"There is a SOUND from the receiver, like chewing...",
"The chewing continues. She slams the receiver down.",
"Almost immediately, the phone RINGS again. Laurie looks at                it. It rings again. She picks it up.",
"Laurie hangs up.",
"The two men begin walking along through the graveyard,                winding around headstones and flowers.",
"Taylor stops cold.",
"He points to a plot right in front of them. Loomis stares.",
"The headstone is missing, uprooted from the ground.",
"Taylor checks his notebook, then counts the rows and plots.",
"Taylor gives Loomis a quizzical look. Loomis shakes his                head and looks out across the graveyard.",
"Laurie turns her gaze down the street",
"More CHILDREN in costumes walk from house to house, some                with MOTHERS and SISTERS, trick or treating. The wind blows                their costumes, billowing them outward.",
"She watches the trick-or-treaters as a car swings around                the corner and pulls up in front of her. It is Annie.",
"Laurie walks around to the passenger door and gets in.",
"Annie pulls away from the curb and hands Laurie a joint.",
"Laurie lights the joint and puffs vigorously.",
"Behind them through the rear-view mirror, we see Loomis'                station wagon pull out of an alley and follow along.",
"Annie's car drives through the main square of Haddonfield.                Following behind is the station wagon.",
"Annie points up ahead and quickly hides the joint.",
"Two police cars are parked in the street in front of Nichols                Hardware Store. An ALARM BELL inside the store CLANGS                SHRILLY.",
"They quickly roll down the windows and begin wildly clearing                out the marijuana smoke. Behind them the station wagon                disappears off down a side street.",
"Annie's car stops at the police cars. Lee Brackett strolls                out to the car and leans down to the window.",
"Annie turns to Laurie.",
"Behind Brackett, Sam Loomis walks up the street. We see                Loomis talk to a COP who points to Brackett.",
"Just as Brackett is about to speak the alarm goes off.",
"Brackett smiles as Loomis walks up behind him.",
"Annie's car pulls away.",
"As they talk CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES AROUND THEM to a view of                the street.",
"Loomis' station wagon moves by behind them. Loomis doesn't                see it.",
"Through the blowing trees we see the full moon rising in                the night sky. There are SOUNDS of wind and CHIRPING                CRICKETS.",
"Annie's car moves down a quiet little residential street                and pulls up in front of a two-story house set back from                the street: the Doyle house.",
"We are in the front seat of the station wagon. Through the                windshield we see Laurie get out of Annie's car, say goodbye                and walk up to the Doyle's house.",
"Then Annie's car makes a wide U-turn in the street and                starts down the other direction. The station wagon pulls                forward and follows her.",
"Annie stops three houses down the street and pulls into a                garage. The station wagon stops several feet away.",
"We see Annie come out of the garage and walk to another                two-story frame house: the Wallace's.",
"The shape gets out of the station wagon, close to CAMERA                so we can't see him. He glances down the street. Gusts of                wind blow the costumes of children going from house to                house.",
"The shape moves. CAMERA TRACKS behind him as he walks toward                the Wallace house.",
"The shape stops in front. Through the front room windows                we can see Annie talking to the WALLACES as they put on                their coats.",
"The front door opens. CAMERA and shape quickly move behind                a tree to hide from sight.",
"The Wallaces step out of their house and walk to the garage.                 Annie and LINDSEY WALLACE, a pretty little nine-year-old,                stand in the doorway framed by the hall light. Out of the                garage comes the Wallace's car. It turns and disappears                down the street.",
"Annie closes the door. The shape steps out from behind the                tree and stares at the house.",
"The shape moves to see inside a window of the Wallace house.",
"Inside, we see Annie turn on the TV. She goes to a mirror                on the wall and begins to brush her hair.",
"Looking down the side of the house we see Loomis and                Brackett walk up to the front porch. A broken, rusted rain                gutter CLANGS back and forth against the house in the wind.",
"The front door slowly opens. Brackett and Loomis stand in                the doorway. They glance at each other. Brackett draws his                gun and the two men step inside.",
"It is totally dark in the house. Brackett's flashlight                comes on, illuminating the two men. As they move through                the house CAMERA TRACKS with them.",
"Suddenly Brackett stops. He trains his flashlight on a small                object in the corner of the room.",
"For a moment Brackett doesn't speak. Then he steps closer                to the object.",
"Both men look down off screen at the animal. Brackett bends                down to it.",
"He stands back up and looks at Loomis.",
"Brackett gets a disgusted expression and steps away.",
"Brackett looks back at the dead animal.",
"Loomis and Brackett cautiously step into the bedroom, the                same room where the murder took place fifteen years ago.                 The glow from a distant streetlight casts the shadows of                blowing trees on the walls.",
"Loomis walks over to the spot where the sister was sitting.",
"Loomis turns and glances at the window. He slowly walks                toward it.",
"Loomis stops by the window.",
"Blown loose by the wind, the rain gutter suddenly swings                down and SMASHES through the window with a THUNDERING CRASH                of broken glass.",
"Loomis jumps back, reaches into his coat pocket and draws                a .357 magnum revolver.",
"Brackett stares at him. Loomis sees Brackett's reaction                and slowly reholsters the revolver.",
"Brackett just looks at him a moment.",
"Brackett turns and walks out of the bedroom. For a moment                Loomis stares at the rain gutter in the broken window.",

"From the house Annie hears the phone ring.",

"From outside the car we see the struggle inside. Annie's                Anguished face presses against the steamed window. Her                SCREAMS are muffled by the closed car.",
"Suddenly, the struggle stops.",

"Lindsey turns around and looks for Tommy.",
"No answer. Lindsey gets up from the couch to search for                Tommy.",

"Laurie shakes her head and walks back into the kitchen.",
"The old Myers house looks ominous and foreboding silhouetted                against the dark, whishing trees. CAMERA TRACKS behind the                hedge to where Loomis sits waiting.",
"Suddenly, there are noises from the street. Loomis parts                the hedge in front of him and stares.",
"Three boys, Keith, Richie, and Lonnie (from the playground)                creep up to the edge of the sidewalk in front of the old                house. They stare fearfully at the dark, tomb-like                structure.",

"Lonnie makes it to the front porch and tentatively steps                up to the door. He glances back to his friends in the                street.",
"Loomis' POV moves to the street.",
"Then Loomis' POV moves back to Lonnie at the front door.                The boy turns to open the door. He's scared out of his                mind",
"Loomis quietly stands up behind the hedge.",
"Lonnie spins around and stares in horror at the talking                hedge.",
"Moving like the wind, Lonnie barrels off the porch and                races back to his friends. The three boys hurtle off down                the dark street in utter terror.",
"He watches them race away, smiling to himself.",

"Standing there is Brackett.",
"Brackett turns and walks back to the street. Loomis watches                him for several moments.",

"The living room is empty. The lights are off. Lynda and                Bob enter the house and begin turning on the lights.",
"Bob walks over to Lynda.",
"They embrace. Bob pulls Lynda over to the couch and turns                out the light. They kiss. A shadow comes over them. They                continue kissing, unaware of the shape of a man on the                stairway watching.",
"The house is totally black inside. The only sound is the                music score from 'The Thing.'",
"Suddenly, the sound of laughter is heard from the kitchen.                Then an orange light floats through the room. As it gets                closer, we see that Laurie is carrying a Jack-o'-lantern,                with a candle illuminating from the center of the pumpkin.                Behind Laurie is Tommy and Lindsey making scary noises.                 The procession continues through the house.",
"The procession continues to the front window. Laurie places                the Jack-o'-lantern on the windowsill. She looks down the                street toward the Wallace's.",
"Laurie sees Bob's car parked in front of the house.",
"Laurie smiles to herself.",
"Laurie sits down on the couch and sighs. Lindsey and Tommy                cuddle up with her, one on either side.",
"The phone rings.",
"Laurie gets up to answer it.",
"Lynda sits on the couch in the dark. Her hair and clothes                are messed up. Bob lies on the couch, his head on her lap.",
"Lynda hangs up the phone and grins.",
"Lynda grabs Bob's hand and stands up.",
"Bob grins.",
"Lynda pulls Bob up from the couch and they walk quickly up                the stairs.",
"Laurie stands by the telephone. She walks to the window                and glances out.",
"It is dark.",
"Laurie shrugs, turns away from the window and walks back                to Tommy and Lindsey sitting on the couch.",
"Sounds of lovemaking come from the bed. The only light is                a candle illuminating the sheets as they move slowly up                and down and from side to side. Empty beer cans leave a                trail from the door to the bed.",
"The moans from Lynda begin increasing. They get louder.                Building to a crescendo. The phone rings. The lovemaking                suddenly stops.",
"Lynda rises up on one arm. The sheet falls away from her,                showing a very beautiful young body. Her hair is a mess                and she is frustrated. The phone continues to ring.",
"Bob opens a fresh can of beer. He chugs it down.",
"The phone stops ringing.",
"Lynda reaches over and kisses Bob behind the ears. She                slowly moves around his ear with her tongue. Bob grabs                Lynda and pushes her down on the bed.",
"Finally, Bob and Lynda climax. Bob rolls off Lynda. She                lights a cigarette and hands it to Bob, then lights one                for herself.",
"Bob gets out of bed and pulls his jeans on. He looks for                his glasses. He finds them and puts them on.",
"Bob leans over and kisses Lynda. He leaves.",
"Lynda leans back onto the pillows. She smiles to herself.",
"Bob comes through the swinging doors. He opens the                refrigerator and takes out two beers. He looks around the                kitchen. He opens some cupboards and takes out a bag of                potato chips. In another cupboard, he finds a can of                peanuts.",
"Bob gathers the food and beer into his arms. He shuts out                the light with his elbow. He turns to leave the doors.                WHAM! He steps into a chair, knocking him backwards. The                beer falls on the floor along with the chips and peanuts.                Bob leans down to pick them up.",
"Bob has his head down, intent on cleaning up the mess.There                is a SLAM from across the kitchen. Bob looks up.",
"The back door of the kitchen slowly swings open, as if it                has been slammed shut and the bolt didn't catch. It squeaks                on its hinges as it swings back and forth.",
"Slowly, Bob gets to his feet and walks over to the door.",
"He steps to the door and looks outside.",
"The yard is empty. Just the wind blowing the trees.",
"He turns from the door.",
"There is a SQUEAK from one of the two closet doors by the                kitchen counter.Bob freezes, staring at the two doors.",
"He walks to one of the doors and opens it. Nothing inside.",
"He steps to the other door and opens it.",
"Right behind the door stands the shape wearing the rubber                mask.",
"He steps out and grabs Bob around the neck in an                instantaneous lunge.",
"Bob tries to jump away, but the shape has a firm hold on                his neck. Bob COUGHS and GAGS from the pressure.",
"Then the shape lifts Bob up off the floor.",
"Bob's feet leave the floor.",
"He makes a guttural sound deep in his throat as the shape's                hand closes tightly around his windpipe.",
"Behind the mask are two burning eyes. The shape moves                forward.",
"Still holding him up with one hand the shape SLAMS Bob                against the wall, holding him up several feet off the floor.                 Bob struggles to get free.",
"The shape lifts his other hand. It holds the butcher knife.",
"The shape drives the knife deeply into Bob's chest with a                SLAMMING THUD, the other end of the knife stuck through                the wall.",
"Then the shape steps away. Bob hangs there, impaled on the                wall, eyes still open in horror, dead.",
"Lynda lounges on the bed smoking another cigarette. She                hears Bob enter the room but doesn't look up.",
"No answer. Lynda turns around and looks.",
"The shape stands in the doorway. He is covered with a sheet                like a ghost. He wears Bob's glasses.",
"The ghost doesn't answer.",
"Lynda looks at the ghost. She slides the sheets down from                her body.",
"Lynda laughs at her own joke, then stops when she sees the                ghost is motionless.",
"Nothing. The ghost just stands there.",
"Lynda gets out of bed. She is nude and looks beautiful and                sensuous in the candle light. She walks over to the phone.",
"Lynda sits down on a chair by the telephone. In the b.g.                the ghost stands in the doorway. She starts to dial the                phone. The ghost starts walking toward her.",
"The house is very quiet. The kids are asleep. Laurie is                sitting on the couch knitting. The phone RINGS.",
"Laurie crosses to answer the phone.",
"Lynda holds the phone to her ear. The ghost walks up slowly                behind her. He raises his hands to grab her.",
"Laurie answers the telephone.",
"Lynda hears Laurie's hello as the ghost grabs the phone.                He clamps one hand over Lynda's mouth. She squirms and                writhes. He takes the telephone cord and wraps it around                her neck.",
"Laurie hears SQUEALS, and rustling sounds across the phone.",
"Laurie continues to hear weird SOUNDS.",
"Lynda tries to fight off the ghost. He wraps the cord around                the neck. He pulls tight. Lynda reaches up and pulls on                the sheet. It slides off of the man, to reveal the grotesque                Halloween mask.",
"Lynda gasps and tries to scream. The man pulls the cord                tighter. Her face turns blue. She opens her mouth, trying                to get air, then slowly slumps forward and remains                motionless. Lynda is dead.",
"The shape picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear.",
"Silence over the phone.",
"Silence.",
"More silence.",
"Suddenly the phone goes dead.",
"Laurie stares at the receiver, then hangs up. She crosses                to the window and looks out toward the Wallace house.",
"The street is quiet, dark and windy. Bob's car is parked                in front of the Wallace house.",
"Suddenly a light goes on in the bedroom.",
"She stares at the house, puzzled.",
"Then the light goes off.",
"Laurie moves from the window back to the telephone and                dials Annie's number. We HEAR the phone ringing on the                other end.",
"Laurie finally hangs up the phone. She stands for a moment                considering it, then turns and walks upstairs.",
"Laurie opens the door to the bedroom. Tommy and Lindsey                are sound asleep on the bed. She looks at them a moment,                then closes the door behind her.",
"Laurie comes back downstairs. She takes a key out of her                purse and again steps to the window.",
"Dark and silent.",
"She steps to the front door.",
"Loomis sits in silence behind the hedge watching the Myers                house. Frustrated, he gets up and walks to the street.",
"For a moment he glances back at the Myers house, then starts                down the quiet residential street.",
"It is empty except for a station wagon parked several blocks                away.",
"He turns away from the street. Then a thought strikes him.                He looks again.",
"The lone car is Loomis' station wagon.",
"He's not certain of it. Slowly Loomis starts walking down                the street toward the station wagon.",
"Laurie locks the Doyle house and walks away out into the                street. The wind whips her clothes and hair.",
"She moves down the street, shivering in the chill wind.",
"She puts the key to the Doyle house in her pocket.",
"Car turns the corner and drives past the Wallace house,                casting a strange shadowy pattern across the front of the                house.",
"She picks up her speed now up the sidewalk.",
"The house looms closer and closer.",
"The station wagon moves closer.",
"He recognizes it and races forward.",
"Laurie walks up to the front porch. She stands there a                moment, listening, as if to hear some sound of life from                the inside.",
"She KNOCKS on the door and RINGS the doorbell. She waits.",
"Silence.",
"She steps off the porch and walks around to the side of                the house, CAMERA TRACKING WITH HER. She moves to the garage                and peeks inside. There is Annie's car.",
"Laurie thinks a moment, then looks to the street.",
"Bob's car sits there on the street.",
"She turns and walks through the breezeway between the house                and the garage around to the back door.",
"The kitchen door is ajar, swinging back and forth in the                wind.",
"Laurie pulls open the door and steps into the house.",
"The kitchen is dark. Laurie stands there a moment staring                into the blackness.",
"No answer.",
"No one answers. Laurie searches for the wall light. She                flips it and nothing happens. She looks again into the                darkness.",
"Nothing. Laurie moves forward into the house, CAMERA                TRACKING WITH HER.",
"Laurie walks into the living room. She stops to let her                eyes get accustomed to the almost total darkness. She                reaches for a nearby lamp and trips over the cord. The                lamp CLUNKS to the floor.",
"Suddenly there is a CRASHING SOUND from upstairs.",
"Laurie spins around and stares up the dark staircase.",
"Another SQUEAK from above.",
"Laurie smiles.",
"Silence.",
"Another SOUND from upstairs, a DRAGGING across the floor.",
"Laurie moves to the head of the staircase.",
"The dragging sound stops abruptly. Silence.",
"Slowly Laurie starts up the staircase.",
"Loomis stands by his car glancing up and down the empty                street. Finally he makes up his mind and starts moving                down the street, almost running, looking back and forth at                the rows of houses on either side for something out of                place.",
"As she slowly moves up the stairs. She reaches the top and                stops.",
"It is totally dark. At the end of the hall is the bedroom                door.  From around the edges of the door is the faintest                orange glow.",
"She moves for the door, CAMERA TRACKING WITH HER.",
"She reaches the door. Her hand reaches out and touches it.",
"The door swings open.",
"She moves forward toward the bed.",
"At the head of the bed is Judith Myer's tombstone.",
"She stares at the bed and then SCREAMS at the top of her                lungs.",
"Suddenly something drops down at her from above.",
"Laurie jumps back to the door.",
"Strung up to the light fixture on the ceiling, dangling                there in the middle of the room, is Bob, eyes open and                staring.",
"Laurie backs out of the bedroom. Her mouth is open in                speechless horror.",
"Suddenly a door next to her slowly opens. There is Lynda                standing there, propped up by a chair, staring at her with                glazed, dead eyes.",
"Laurie shrinks back into a dark corner. She can only stare                in horror at the sight of her friend.",
"Suddenly we are aware of something there in the dark                corner.",
"It is almost as if our eyes have suddenly begun to adjust                to the darkness and we see the outline of a man standing                right behind her.",
"The outline becomes more and more clear. It is the shape,                wearing the mask, the butcher knife in his hand, gleaming,                right behind Laurie.",
"Laurie suddenly moves away from the corner.",
"The shape lunges out at her.",
"The hand grasps a piece of Laurie's blouse and RIPS it.",
"She SCREAMS and spins around.",
"He stands there holding up the piece of material, then                raises the butcher knife and moves for her.",
"He lunges at her suddenly with the knife.",
"The knife slices across her arm, ripping her flesh.",
"Laurie suddenly jumps backward, raising her arm                instinctively.",
"Laurie bumps back into the railing.",
"He lunges again with the knife.",
"She leaps backward to avoid the blade and slips over the                edge of the railing.",
"She hits the floor and rolls over, holding her leg                painfully. Then she looks up at the staircase.",
"The shape moves to the top of the staircase and starts                down toward her.",
"She pulls herself up off the floor and hobbles into the                living room.",
"The shape races down the stairs.",
"She moves for the kitchen. She trips on the fallen lamps                and falls to the floor.",
"The shape steps into the living room, knife raised.",
"She crawls to the kitchen, rolls inside and SLAMS the                kitchen door behind her. In a flash she leaps up and CLICKS                the lock.",
"There is a POUNDING on the door from the other side.",
"Laurie slowly climbs to her feet and limps toward the back                door.",
"Suddenly the kitchen door EXPLODES, the middle of it                breaking apart. The shape reaches through, groping for the                lock.",
"Laurie reaches the back door.",
"Her hand tries the door. It is key-locked.",
"Desperately she tries the door, glancing behind her.",
"The shape's hand reaches for the lock.",
"She steps back from the door into the kitchen.",
"She sees the kitchen window over the sink.",
"She hobbles to the sink, climbs up on it and grabs the                window. With a heave she opens it up halfway.",
"The shape's hand grabs the lock and CLICKS it open.",
"She can only get it three-fourths open. Headfirst she crawls                through the window.",
"The shape pushes the door open and leaps into the kitchen.",
"She drags herself roughly out the window.",
"The shape grabs at Laurie's legs as they disappear through                the sill.",
"Laurie picks herself up from the ground and runs as fast                as she can, limping across the backyard, CAMERA MOVING                WITH HER. She passes the driveway and scurries into the                neighbor's backyard, up to the back door of the house. She                POUNDS furiously on the door.",
"She looks behind her.",
"No sign of the shape. The house is dark and silent.",
"The back porch light comes on. Laurie continues to POUND                on the door.",
"Through the glass in the back door we see an OLD WOMAN                dressed in a nightgown approach.",
"The old woman stares at her suspiciously for a moment,                then turns from the door and walks away.",
"The porch light goes out.",
"She turns around and looks back.",
"Nothing. No sign of the shape.",
"She hobbles off the back porch and runs across the yard to                the street.  CAMERA MOVES WITH HER as she limps along.",
"Laurie rushes up to the front door. She reaches in her                pocket for the key and drops it on the porch.",
"Quickly she bends down and scrambles for it. She looks                back toward the street.",
"The street is empty. The wind WHISHES the trees. Leaves                sprinkle down.",
"Laurie gropes around for the key. It lies over a crack in                the wooden porch. She reaches for it but her finger nudge                the key between the crack, down out of sight.",
"Laurie SCREAMS with frustration and glances back at the                street.",
"The shape walks slowly down the middle of the street, right                toward her!",
"Laurie begins to BANG on the front door.",
"She grabs a planter on the porch, steps back and hurls it                at an upstairs window.",
"The planter SMASHES against the window. A light goes on.                Tommy appears sleepily at the window.",
"She looks back at the street.",
"The street is empty. The shape is gone.",
"She stands there breathlessly, her eyes burning in the                darkness.",
"Finally the door opens. Tommy stands there in his pajamas.",
"Laurie leaps inside and SLAMS the door.",
"Laurie bolts the door from the inside.",
"Tommy turns and runs upstairs CRYING.",
"Laurie moves from the door to the telephone. She picks it                up, dials a number and waits.",
"Then suddenly she reacts..  The phone is dead. No dial                tone.",
"She puts down the phone and stands very still. There is a                slight breeze blowing her hair.Slowly Laurie moves around                the couch.",
"From the living room we see into the kitchen. The back                door is open.",
"Laurie doesn't move.  She begins crying softly, her eyes                wide with fear.",
"Silence. No movement anywhere in the house.Slowly Laurie                sinks down to her knees by the couch.",
"Her hand brushes against the knitting needles protruding                from her tote bag.",
"She reacts to the feel of the knitting needles and pulls                one out. It is long and deadly sharp. She stares at it.",
"Suddenly the shape leaps up from behind the couch! He                springs at her, plunging the butcher knife.",
"The blade of the butcher knife THUMPS into the couch.",
"Instinctively Laurie raises the knitting needle and drives                it home, right into the shape's neck!",
"The shape springs backward, clawing at the needle, rolling                his head back and forth. Then suddenly he freezes, hands                outstretched, motionless, and falls in a heap on the floor.",
"Laurie sits there.",
"The shape doesn't move.",
"Laurie begins to cry again, harder and harder.",
"Brackett turns and hurries back to the car.",
"Loomis starts up the street again as Brackett pulls off in                the other direction.",
"Slowly Laurie stands up, stares at the shape and then moves                to the staircase.",
"Slowly, painfully, Laurie climbs up the stairs.",
"Tommy and Lindsey are huddled in a corner WHIMPERING softly.                The door opens and Laurie steps in. The two children run                to her CRYING. She holds them in her arms tightly and nudges                the door shut with her foot.",
"She takes the children back to the bed and sits down with                them.",
"Suddenly the bedroom door swings open. Standing there is                the shape, the butcher knife raised.",
"Both children SCREAM. Laurie shoves them into the bathroom                and pulls the door shut, leaving herself outside in the                bedroom.",
"The shape moves for her, slowly now, but relentless, the                knife glistening.",
"There is a CLICK as the bathroom door is locked. Laurie                leaps away from the door and circles around the bed.",
"The shape keeps coming.",
"Laurie dashes to a clothes closet and ducks inside.",
"Laurie pulls the sliding doors closed and crawls back into                the small, dark interior of the closet.",
"Suddenly the doors begin to buckle as the shape pounds on                them.",
"She reaches up and grabs a wire hanger from the top of the                closet. She rips off the shirt and begins unhooking it.",
"The door buckles inward as the shape SMASHES against it.",
"She twists the top of the hanger, unwinding the wire.",
"The door BREAKS IN. The shape steps inside, pushing aside                the clothes.",
"She unhooks the hanger and bends it out straight.",
"The shape leans in, peering down at Laurie in the corner,                raising the knife.",
"Holding the hanger with both hands she thrusts it forward                with all her might.",
"The wire hanger flashes into the shape's right eye.He leaps                back in pain, dropping the butcher knife, grabbing his eye                with both hands.",
"She grasps the butcher knife with both hands and jabs it                upward.",
"The butcher knife plunges into the shape's mid-section,                right down to the hilt. The shape stumbles backward out of                the closet.",
"She just sits there in the corner of the closet. There is                a THUMP from the bedroom, then silence.",
"Slowly Laurie crawls around and peeks out of the closet                doors.",
"The shape lies on the floor by the bed, the butcher knife                protruding from his stomach.",
"Laurie emerges from the closet and carefully crosses the                bedroom, avoiding the shape's body. She goes to the bathroom                door and knocks softly.",
"There is a silence, then the door opens. On the other side                are Tommy and Lindsey, looking utterly terrified. Laurie                bends down and shields them from the sight of the shape.",
"She stands up and guides the children carefully across the                bedroom to the door and ushers them outside.",
"She watches for a moment as they walk down the stairs,                then slumps down against the door frame in an exhausted                heap.",
"Tommy and Lindsey run out of the house and down the walk                to the sidewalk. They rush up the street. As they leave                frame we see Loomis on the other side of the street.",
"He watches the children with a puzzled frown.",
"Shrieking with fear, Tommy and Lindsey run up the sidewalk.",
"He stares at them for a moment, then moves for the Doyle                house.",
"We SEE through the bedroom door. In f.g. sits Laurie,                slumped against the door frame, staring out at nothing,                tears streaming down her face. In b.g. lies the shape.",
"Slowly Laurie begins to pull herself together once again.",
"She gets up to her knees and begins to pull herself up to                her feet.",
"Her back is to the shape. As she starts to stand the shape                sits up, the head turning to Laurie.",
"Laurie rises into frame, holding herself erect by grasping                the doorframe.",
"Behind her the shape rises up into frame, quickly, silently.",
"Laurie just hangs there on the doorframe. An exhausted,                ironic smile comes over her face.",
"Slowly the shape moves for her, his hands outstretched.",
"Just as he is about to grab her, Laurie manages to step                out the door.",
"Unaware he is behind her, Laurie limps toward the stairs.",
"Suddenly the shape jumps out of the bedroom and grabs her,                hands around her neck.",
"Laurie SCREAMS. She twists and squirms and claws at him,                her finger ripping at his mask. She pulls it off over his                face, wriggles out of his grip and turns around.",
"The shape, Michael, stares at her with his one eye. He has                a dank, white face with blond hair. There is something                completely unhuman about his features, the open mouth, the                dark staring eye.",
"Michael lunges at her again.",
"Suddenly there is a THUNDERING EXPLOSION and Michael is                blown off his feet. Laurie falls back against the wall.",
"Standing at the top of the stairs is Loomis, gun in his                hand. He moves forward down the hall.",
"Michael slowly gets to his feet, still refusing to die.",
"Loomis stops and takes aim. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!",
"Michael is hit three times, each bullet throwing him                backward further down the hall until he hits the window at                the end and SMASHES through it.",
"Michael falls from the second story right down into CAMERA                with a CRASH!",
"Loomis rushes to Laurie and bends down beside her. For a                moment she just cries in his arms, sobbing hysterically.",
"Then she looks up at him with a glazed, wild expression.",
"Loomis looks down at her, then up at the shattered window                at the end of the hall.",
"He walks slowly down to the window and peers out.",
"He looks down at the spot where Michael should be, but                there is nothing there, just a trampled patch in the grass.",
"He stares down with a growing fear, then looks out from                the house.",
"The backyard, the neighboring yards, the street, all are                empty, quiet, dark. There is only the SOUND of the wind                swelling in the trees.",
"Michael is gone.",
"Campbell : It's been a long time Snake.",
"Snake    : I should've known you were behind this, Colonel.",
"Campbell : That's no way to greet an old war buddy Snake.",
"Snake    : What do you want from me?",
"Campbell : I just invited you here so we could have a talk.",
"Snake    : Invited!? That's what you call sending armed soldiers after me?",
"Campbell : Sorry if they were a little rough with you. But we've got a serious           situation here. Only you can get us out of it.",
"Snake    : I'm retired from FOX-HOUND. You're not my commander anymore, and I           don't have to take orders from you or anyone else.",
"Campbell : You will take these orders. I know it.",
"Naomi    : Excuse me.",
"Snake    : Who's this?",
"Campbell : Dr. Naomi Hunter. She's chief of FOX-HOUND's medical staff and an           expert in gene therapy.",
"Snake    : Are you military?",
"Naomi    : No, civilian. I've been sent here from ATGC. Pleasure to meet you",
"Naomi    :  Don't worry this injection won't hurt a bit.",
"Snake    : What's the shot for?",
"Naomi    : What's wrong? You don't like shots?",
"Campbell : Snake listen up. It all went down five hours ago. Heavily armed           soliders occupied Shadow Moses Island, a remote island off the           coast of Alaska.",
"Snake    : What soldiers?",
"Campbell : Next-Generation Special Forces led by members of unit FOX-HOUND.           They've presented Washington with a single demand, and they say           that if it isn't met, they'll launch a nuclear weapon.",
"Snake    : A nuclear weapon?",
"Campbell : I'm afraid so. You see, the island is the site of a secret nuclear           weapons disposal facility.",
"Snake    : FOX-HOUND hijacking a nuclear weapon?",
"Campbell : Now you understand how serious the situation is. You'll have two           mission objectives. First, you're to rescue the DARPA (Defense           Advanced Research Projects Agency) Chief, Donald Anderson, and the           president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker. They're both being held as           hostages.",
"Snake    : Those are some heavy duty hostages.",
"Campbell : Secondly, you're to investigate whether or not the terrorists have           the ability to launch a nuclear strike, and stop them if they do.           Any questions, Snake?",
"Snake    : Questions? I haven't even said whether I'd accept this mission.",
"Campbell : Well you can make up your mind after you hear more about the           situation.",
"Snake    : Tell me about the nuclear weapons disposal facility.",
"Campbell : The disposal facility includes a hardened underground base. Even           with our most advanced intelligence gathering equipment, we can't           tell what's happening inside.",
"Snake    : So someone needs to penetrate, gather intelligence, and report           back... Sounds like a spy movie. What's the insertion method?",
"Campbell : Well an air insertion is impossible.",
"Snake    : Not with this storm going on.",
"Campbell : We'll approach the disposal facility by sub.",
"Snake    : Approach?",
"Campbell : Yes, within a few miles of it. The facility is equipped with sonar           detection capability. They'd be able to hear our engine or           propeller noise.",
"Snake    : And then?",
"Campbell : We'll launch a one-man SDV (swimmer delivery vehicle).",
"Snake    : Launch?",
"Campbell : Same as a torpedo. Only this has no propulsion device of its own.           After the SDV gets as close as it can, dispose of it. From there           on you'll have to swim.",
"Snake    : You want me to swim in sub-zero Alaskan water?",
"Campbell : Don't worry. That suit represents the latest advances in poly-           thermal technology. The nuclear weapons disposal facility covers           the whole island. I'll contact you by Codec after you reach your           target.",
"Snake    : Anyone going with me?",
"Campbell : As usual, this is a one-man inflitration mission.",
"Snake    : Weapons and equipment OSP (on-site procurement)?",
"Campbell : Yes. This a top-secret black op. Don't expect any official support.",
"Snake    : The Chief of DARPA and the president of an arms manufacturing           company... what business did they have at a nuclear weapons           disposal facility?",
"Campbell : The truth is that secret exercises were being conducted at the time           the terrorist group attacked.",
"Snake    : Must be extremely important exercises if those two were directly           involved. Were they testing some kind of new advanced weapon?",
"Campbell : I'm not privy to that information.",
"Snake    : Do we know exactly where they're being held?",
"Naomi    : The DARPA chief has also been injected with a mini-transmitter. As           you get closer you should be able to pick up his location on your           radar.",
"Snake    : Do they really have the ability to launch a nuclear missile?",
"Campbell : They say they do. They even gave us the serial number of the           warhead they plan to use.",
"Snake    : Was the number confirmed?",
"Campbell : I'm afraid so. At the very least, they've got their hands on a real           nuclear warhead.",
"Snake    : Isn't there some kind of safety device to prevent this kind of           terrorism?",
"Campbell : Yes. Every missile and warhead in our arsenal is equipped with a           PAL, which uses a discreet detonation code.",
"Snake    : PAL?",
"Campbell : Permissive Action Link. A safety control system built into all           nuclear weapons systems. But even so, we can't rest easy.",
"Snake    : Why not?",
"Campbell : Because the DARPA Chief knows the detonation code.",
"Snake    : But even if they have a nuclear warhead, it must've been removed           from its missile. All the missiles on these disposal sites are           supposed to be dismantled. It's not that easy to get your hands on           an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missle).",
"Campbell : That used to be true, but since the end of the Cold War you can get           anything if you have enough money and the right connections.",
"Snake    : So what exactly are they demanding?",
"Campbell : A person's remains.",
"Snake    : Remains?",
"Campbell : That's right. To be more accurate, cell specimens which contain the           individual's genomic information.",
"Snake    : Cell specimens? Why would they want that?",
"Campbell : The terrorists need them. You see these Next-Generation Special           Forces have been strengthened through gene therapy.",
"Snake    : Strengthened?",
"Campbell : You've heard of the Human Genome Project. They've been mapping the           human genome, and they're nearly finished. Following up on this           research, the military has been working towards identifiying those           genes which are responsible for making effective soldiers.",
"Snake    : There are genes that do that?",
"Campbell : Yes, and using gene therapy they're able to transplant those genes           into regular soldiers.",
"Snake    : Gene therapy?",
"Naomi    : I'll explain this part. With gene therapy, we can remove those           genes which we know may lead to sickness or disease, and that the           same time, splice in genes with beneficial effects such as           resistance to cancer for example.",
"Campbell : In other words, we can overcome all sorts of genetic diseases and           at the same time add genetic characteristics as desired.",
"Snake    : Okay, and so if you knew what genes were responsible for making           the perfect soldier, you could implant them in the same way, right?",
"Naomi    : Yes we could.",
"Campbell : But it all depends on being able to isolate and identify those           'soldier genes'.",
"Naomi    : And in order to do that, it's helpful to study the genomic           information of one of the greatest soldiers ever.",
"Snake    : One of the greatest soldiers ever?",
"Naomi    : The man they call the greatest warrior of the twentieth century.",
"Snake    : You don't mean Big Boss?!",
"Naomi    : That's right. We've been working feverishly to identify the genes           responsible for his incredible combat skill. So far we've           discovered about sixty of the so-called 'soldier genes.'",
"Snake    : So his body was recovered after all.",
"Campbell : Yes, and his cells have remained frozen in cryo-chamber. His           genomic information is a priceless treasure to mankind.",
"Snake    : Priceless to the military perhaps.",
"Naomi    : His body was burned severely, but it was possible to restore his           DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) profile from just a single strand of           his hair.",
"Snake    : You people are amazing. And then you're going to transplant those           genes into soldiers?",
"Naomi    : Yes. We'll use a process that I discovered called gene targeting.           The strongest soldiers don't become what they are by acquiring           their skills through training or experience, we now know that           hereditary factors are far more crucial for creating superior           soldiers.",
"Campbell : Snake, we can't give them his body. It's potentially more dangerous           than all the warheads on that island put together.",
"Naomi    : I hear the terrorists are calling themselves the 'Sons of Big           Boss.'",
"Snake    : The Sons of Big Boss.",
"Snake    : What's the time limit?",
"Campbell : 24 hours. They say they'll launch after 24 hours.",
"Snake    : Did they say what the target will be?",
"Campbell : So far they haven't mentioned a target.",
"Snake    : When did the countdown start?",
"Campbell : 5 hours ago.",
"Snake    : Colonel, who are you speaking for?",
"Campbell : Naturally, I'm representing the US government.",
"Snake    : So who's in supervisory control of this operation?",
"Campbell : The President of the United States.",
"Snake    : Which means that the President must be meeting with his top aides           in the map room about now, huh?",
"Campbell : No at this point they're still video conferencing with each other.",
"Snake    : If that's a real nuclear warhead, shouldn't they issue a COG           (Continuity of Government)?",
"Campbell : Not yet. The Secretary of Defense has operational control and is           fully aware of the situation. After you infiltrate, if you           determine they possess nuclear launch capabilities a COG will be           issued.",
"Snake    : Well if they haven't relocated to nuclear shelter under Mount           Washingtion, I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry yet.           Is the National Security Agency in on this?",
"Campbell : Yes. So is the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency.",
"Snake    : The DIA? I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this.",
"Campbell : They'll be sending us some support.",
"Snake    : We don't need desk jockies. We need a nuclear weapons specialist.",
"Campbell : Of course. A nuclear weapons specialist has already been assigned           to us.",
"Snake    : We need backup from a specialist. I'm just an amateur when it comes           to nuclear weapons.",
"Campbell : I know. That's why I've requested the assistance of a military           analyst named Nastasha Romanenko. She'll be providing you backup           by Codec.",
"Snake    : A female analyst?",
"Campbell : She's built up an impressive record as an advisor to the Nuclear           Emergency Search Team. Contact her if you have any questions.           She's also an expert on hi-tech weapons.",
"Snake    : Where's she working from?",
"Campbell : At her home in Los Angeles.",
"Snake    : California. Seems like a million miles away.",
"Snake    : How well-armed are these terrorists? I know there was an exercise           going on at the time they revolted.",
"Campbell : They're heavily armed I'm afraid.",
"Snake    : What about they're battle experience.",
"Campbell : The six members of FOX-HOUND in charge are all hardened veterans.           They're tough enough to eat nails and ask for seconds.",
"Snake    : I wouldn't expect anything less from FOX-HOUND.",
"Campbell : The others are Next-Generation Special Forces. They're not your           average grunts either.",
"Snake    : Tell me about these Next-Generation Special Forces.",
"Campbell : They started out as an anti-terrorist special-ops unit made up of           members from former biochem units, technical escort units, and the           Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Their purpose was to respond to           threats involving next-generation weapons of mass destruction,           including NBC (nuclear/biological/chemica) weapons.",
"Naomi    : Until 'they' were added that is.",
"Snake    : Who's 'they'?",
"Campbell : These guys didn't start out as regular army.",
"Snake    : Looks like a pretty international group. Mercenaries?",
"Campbell : Yeah. And it gets worse. Most of them were from a merc agency that I           think you're familiar with. They were part of Big Boss' private           guard. And after Big Boss went down, the military just bought out           all their contracts.",
"Snake    : Outer Heaven.",
"Campbell : After that they were merged with our own VR unit, Force 21, and           re-trained. If you ask me, these so-called 'Next-Generation Special           Forces' should to be called 'simulated soldiers.' They have no           real battle experience.",
"Snake    : Video game players, huh?",
"Naomi    : Don't forget they've all been strengthened with gene therapy. They           carry genes which make them excellent soldiers. Don't get careless           just because they don't have much experience.",
"Snake    : I thought using genetically modified soldiers was prohibited by           international law.",
"Naomi    : Yes, but those are just declarations not actual treaties.",
"Campbell : The interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit           conspired in this attack.",
"Snake    : How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion?",
"Naomi    : They're calling it a revolution.",
"Campbell : Since they all went through the same gene therapy, they probably           felt closer than brothers. They see the unit as their only family.",
"Snake    : The Sons of Big Boss. But if they were regular army, they must've           been interviewed periodically by army counsellers.",
"Campbell : According to their files, they all got straight A's on their           psychological tests. They all seemed like fine, upstanding           patriotic soldiers.",
"Snake    : But they all took part in the uprising?",
"Campbell : No. Several people didn't show up on the day of the exercise.           That's why there was a resupply of troops.",
"Snake    : Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong?",
"Campbell : There was a report a month ago that they were acting strangely.",
"Naomi    : Apparently they consulted classified information about the soldier           genes and performed their own gene therapy experiments.",
"Snake    : They can do that even without you?",
"Naomi    : Well our gene therapy process is almost completely automated. And           besides that they're all geniuses with IQs over 180.",
"Campbell : Even the existence of this genome army is a national secret of the           highest order. We'd been hoping to investigate this quietly and           deal with it behind closed doors.",
"Campbell : Hi-Tech special forces unit FOX-HOUND. Your former unit, and           one that I was a commander of. An elite group combining firepower           and expertise. They're every bit as good as when I was commanding           them.",
"Snake    : So they're still around.",
"Campbell : There are six members of FOX-HOUND involved in this terrorist           activity. Psycho Mantis, with his powerful psychic abilities. Sniper           Wolf, the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter. Decoy Octopus, master           of disguise. Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman. And Revolver Ocelot,           specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter.",
"Snake    : Looks like a lovely bunch of folks. Too bad we'll be meeting under           these circumstances.",
"Campbell : And finally, in charge of them, FOX-HOUND's squad leader Liquid           Snake.",
"Snake    : Liquid Snake?!",
"Campbell : Yes and you're the only person who can stand against him.",
"Snake    : Liquid Snake.",
"Campbell : Liquid Snake. The man with the same codename as you.",
"Snake    : Tell me what you know.",
"Campbell : He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager, the youngest person in the           SAS (British Special Air Service).  His job was to track down and           destroy mobile SCUD missile launching platforms. You were there too           I believe. Didn't you infiltrate western Iraq with a platoon of           Green Berets?",
"Snake    : I was just a kid myself back then.",
"Campbell : The details are classified, but it seems that originally he           penetrated the the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS.",
"Snake    : He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service?",
"Campbell : But he never once showed his face in Century House. He was taken           prisoner in Iraq, and after that there was no trace of him for           several years. After you retired, he was rescued and became a member           of FOX-HOUND.",
"Snake    : I thought that by the time I left they were no longer using           codenames.",
"Campbell : I don't know his real name. That information is so highly classified           that even I can't look at it. Here's a photo of him.  Pretty           shocking, huh?  His skin tone is a little different but otherwise           you two are exact duplicates.",
"Snake    : I have a twin?",
"Campbell : I don't know the details, but it seems so. That's why we really need           you for this mission.",
"Naomi    : You're the only one who can beat him. Now that I've met you, I know.           You've got something he doesn't. I can see it in your eyes.",
"Snake    : Why don't I find that thought more comforting?",
"Snake    : Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore. Let me go back to           Twin Lakes.",
"Campbell : Why Snake? Is your life in Alaska all that great?",
"Snake    : There's a dogsled race this week. Next Saturday I have to be in           Anchorage.",
"Campbell : The Iditarod? The longest sled race in the world? When did you           become a dog musher?",
"Snake    : Right now my fifty huskies are my only family. I've got to take care           of them.",
"Campbell : Don't worry about your dogs.",
"Snake    : What do you mean?",
"Campbell : I'm sorry Snake but this vessel is headed for the Bering Sea.           There's no room for debate.",
"Snake    : I told you, even if I do owe you I don't anything to this army or           this country!",
"Campbell : You will accept this assignment!",
"Snake    : Why should I be stupid enough to do that? I'm no patriot.",
"Campbell : Snake, there's enough dirt in your file from your days as an agent           to keep you in the stockade until you're a very old man.",
"Snake    : Oh I see. Blackmail.",
"Campbell : No Snake. I prefer to look at it as helping you to come to a           decision more easily. But anyway, I know you better than that. You'd           take this assignment even without the threat.",
"Snake    : Why do you say that?",
"Campbell : You're a natural born soldier. You're not the grow old gracefully           type. Same for all of us who've seen real action. The only place we           can feel truly alive is on the battlefield. I'm a solider too. I           know those feelings of powerlessness, frustration that you feel           everyday. You've tried to play the boy scout out there in Alaska,           but you can't race dogs in the snow forever.  Why don't you come           back to us and be a soldier again.",
"Snake    : You think my life is some kind of joke?",
"Campbell : Snake, I just want to give you back your purpose in life.",
"Snake    : Colonel, you're retired. Why are you involved in this?",
"Campbell : Becaue there aren't many people who know FOX-HOUND as well as I do.",
"Snake    : Is that really the only reason?",
"Campbell : I've been soldiering for a long time, I don't know anything else. I           guess even though I'm getting a little old, I still love to be in           the field.",
"Snake    : Colonel, you're a lousy liar. Tell me the real reason.",
"Campbell : Okay Snake. Sorry. I'll be frank. A person very dear to me is being           held hostage.",
"Snake    : Who is it?",
"Campbell : My neice. Meryl.",
"Snake    : What was your niece doing here?",
"Campbell : Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the revolt. And           my niece was one of those called in as an emergency replacement.",
"Snake    : She looks like you.",
"Campbell : She's my little brother's girl. He died in the Gulf War. Since then           I've been watching after her.",
"Snake    : A personal motive, Colonel. That's not very soldierly.",
"Campbell : I'm retired. I'm just an old man now. And I'm your friend.",
"Snake    : Since when are we friends?",
"Campbell : I've thought of us as friends since the fall of Zanzibar.",
"Snake    : With my personality I don't have too many friends.",
"Campbell : That's what I trust about you. It's what makes you human. Please           Snake. Save my niece Meryl.",
"Snake    : All right, but I have two conditions.",
"Campbell : Name them.",
"Snake    : One, no more secrets between us. I want complete disclosure at all           times and two, I'll only accept orders from you, Colonel. No cutoffs           involved okay?",
"Campbell : Agreed. That's why I was called. But one thing.",
"Snake    : What?",
"Campbell : I'm not a colonel anymore. Just a retired old warhorse.",
"Snake    : I understand, Colonel.",
"Snake    : That doctor. Is she part of this operation too?",
"Campbell : She was in charge of FOX-HOUND's gene therapy. She knows more about           those men than anyone else.",
"Snake    : You mean you've seen them naked?",
"Naomi    : Make no mistake. I'm not a nurse. I'm a scientist.",
"Snake    : By the way, what was that injection for?",
"Naomi    : It's a combination of and nanomachines and an anti-freezing peptide           so that your blood and other bodily fluids don't freeze, even at           sub-arctic temperatures.",
"Snake    : Nanomachines?",
"Naomi    : Not just one kind either. There are different types which will           replenish the supply of adrenaline, nutrition and sugar in your           bloodstream.",
"Snake    : Now I don't have to worry about food.",
"Naomi    : I also put some nootropics in there.",
"Snake    : Say what?",
"Naomi    : Nootropics. It's a class of drugs which wil help improve your           mental functioning.",
"Snake    : It'll make smarter huh? Anything else?",
"Naomi    : Benzedrine. It's a type of stimulant. It'll keep you alert and           responsive for twelve straight hours.",
"Snake    : That was quite a cocktail. Anything else in there?",
"Naomi    : Those nanomachines will also keep your Codec's batteries charged up.",
"Snake    : I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet.",
"Naomi    : You're welcome.",
"Snake    : I need to borrow your scissors.",
"Naomi    : What are you going to do?",
"Snake    : Don't worry. Just going to clean myself up a little.",
"Naomi    : Huh?",
"Snake    : I don't want to be mistaken for the leader of the terrorists.",
"Liquid   : Stay alert!  He'll be through here, I know it.  I'm going to go           swat down a couple of bothersome flies.",
"Snake    : This is Snake.  Colonel, can you hear me?",
"Campbell : Loud and clear Snake.  What's the situation?",
"Snake    : Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up.",
"Campbell : Just as I expected.  You'll have to take the elevator to the           surface.  But make sure that nobody sees you.  If you need to           contact me by codec, the frequency is 140.85.  When you want to use           the codec push the Select button. When we need to contact you the           codec will beep.  When you hear that noise push the Select button.           The codec directly stimulates the small bones of your ear, no one           but you will be able to hear it.",
"Snake    : Got it, okay, I'm ready to go.",
"Snake    : It's Snake.  I'm in front of the disposal facility.",
"Campbell : Excellent, Snake.  Age hasn't slowed you down one bit.",
"Naomi    : How's that Sneaking Suit working out?",
"Snake    : I'm nice and dry, but it is a little hard to move.",
"Naomi    : Bear with it.  It's designed to prevent hypothermia.  This is           Alaska you know.",
"Snake    : Take it easy, I'm grateful.  If it wasn't for your suit and your           shot I would have turned into a popsicle out there.",
"Naomi    : An anti-freezing peptide Snake.  All of the Genome soldiers in this           excercise are using it.",
"Snake    : I'm relieved to hear that.  Already tested, huh?  By the way, how's           the diversionary operation going?",
"Campbell : Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.  The           terrorist's radar should have picked them up by now.",
"Snake    : A Hind D?  Colonel, what's a Russian gunship doing here?",
"Campbell : I have no idea...but it looks like our little diversion got their           attention.  Now's your best chance to slip in unnoticed.",
"Campbell : There are only 18 hours left until their deadline.  You've got to           hurry.",
"Mei Ling : Wow...you must be crazy to fly a Hind in this kind of           weather.",
"Snake    : Who's that?",
"Campbell : Oh sorry, I haven't introduced you two yet.  This is Mei Ling.  She           was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist.           She designed your codec, as well as your Soliton radar system.           Contact her if you have any questions about either of them.",
"Mei Ling : Nice to meet you Snake.  It's an honor to speak to a living legend           like yourself.",
"Snake    : ......",
"Mei Ling : What's wrong?",
"Snake    : Nothing...I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military           technology to be so...cute.",
"Mei Ling : You're just flattering me...",
"Snake    : No, I'm serious.  Now I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours.",
"Mei Ling : C'mon, I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake...           But I'm surprised, you're very frank for a trained killer.",
"Snake    : Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other.",
"Mei Ling : Yeah, I'm looking forward to meeting the man behind the legend...but           first, let me explain about your Soliton radar system.",
"Mei Ling : The bright dot in the middle is you Snake.  The red dots are your            enemies and the blue cone shape represents their field of vision.",
"Naomi    : Be careful Snake. The Genome soldiers have highly developed senses           of hearing and vision due to their gene therapy.  Make sure you           don’t let them see you.",
"Campbell : First I want you to infiltrate the disposal site and look for the           DARPA Chief.",
"Naomi    : The DARPA Chief was injected with the same GPS transmitting           nanomachines as you.",
"Mei Ling : He should appear on your radar as a green dot.",
"Campbell : Get whatever information you can from him about the terrorists.  If           he’s alive that is...",
"Mei Ling : Snake, your radar isn't affected by the weather, but if you're           discovered by an enemy you won't be able to use it.",
"Campbell : Yes, it gets jammed easily I'm afraid.",
"Mei Ling : Yes, it's all made from currently existing technology.  You won't be           able to use it in an area with strong harmonic resonance.  So be           careful.",
"Campbell : We'll be monitoring your movements by radar... so contact us by           Codec anytime  you want.",
"Snake    : Got it.  I'll call if I'm feeling lonely.",
"Naomi    : Seriously Snake.  We're here to back you up, so call if you need           some information or advice.",
"Mei Ling : I'm also in charge of your mission data.  Contact me if you want me           to record your current status.  My frequency is 140.96.  It's a           dedicated frequency for saving data.  Don't forget it.",
"Campbell : Remember, except for your binoculars you're naked.  You need to arm           yourself with whatever weapons you can find.",
"Snake    : I remember.  First I'm strip searched by Doctor Naomi here, and then           all my weapons are taken away.  Imagine yourself put in that           position.",
"Naomi    : Well, if yck in one you make it back in one peice, maybe I'll let           you do a strip search on me.",
"Snake    : I'll hold you to that doctor.  By the way, sorry to dissapoint you           but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes.",
"Naomi    : How did you do that?",
"Snake    : In my stomach.  Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my           stomach acids.",
"Mei Ling : Cigarettes?  How are those going to help you?",
"Snake    : You never know.",
"Campbell : If you want to get in, there's the front door.",
"Campbell : It's the fastest way, but there's too much risk of being spotted by           the enemy.",
"Snake    : I can't just knock on the door and ask them to let me in.  One           sentry on the left and one on the right.  They're armed with 'five           five sixers' and pineapples...",
"Campbell : What about the air duct near the door?",
"Campbell : There should also be a duct on the second floor.",
"Snake    : I can't see it from here.",
"Campbell : I'll let you decide the best COA.  I'm counting on youSnake.",
"Master   : Snake, it's been a long time.",
"Snake    : Master?  What are you doing here?",
"Master   : I quit being a drill instructor, so I moved out here for some           peace and quiet.  I'm in retirement just like you.  Once in a while           I still help train the Alaskan Scouts.",
"Snake    : Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?",
"Master   : Campbell told me about the situation here.  I thought I might be of           some use.",
"Snake    : There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you.",
"Master   : Well, I know lots about survival in a harsh environment.  I've lived           in Alaska longer than you, so call me if you have any questions           about the flora or fauna out here.  My frequency is 141.80.",
"Genome 1 :I moved the DARPA Chief to the cell in the 1st floor basement.",
"Genome 2 : : What about the vent shaft cleaning?",
"Genome 1 : They just opened the vent covers.  They're about to start spraying           for rats.",
"Snake    : 1st floor basement ventilation shaft...",
"Genome 1 : Shut those covers as soon as they're done spraying.  Also, keep           your eye on that woman in the cell.  Don't get careless now.",
"Snake    : Woman in the cell?",
"Genome 2 : Did something happen?",
"Genome 1 : There's an intruder.",
"Genome 2 : Really?",
"Genome 1 : He's already done three people.",
"Genome 2 : He's killed three people?",
"Genome 1 : Yeah.  They say he's using stealth too.",
"Genome 2 : Stealth?",
"Snake    : There's an intruder besides me?",
"Genome 1 : Anyway, I want you to increase the security detail on the chief.",
"Snake       : I'm here to save you.  You're the DARPA Chief, Donald Anderson,              right?",
"Snake       : I'm the pawn they sent here to save your worthless butt.",
"Snake       : Slow down.  Don't worry.  First I want some information... about              the terrorists.",
"Snake       : Do they really have the ability to launch a nuke?",
"Snake       : The terrorists are threatening the White House.  They say if they              don't accede to their demands they'll launch a nuclear weapon.",
"Snake       : Is it possible?!",
"Snake       : How do they plan to launch?  I though this place was just for",
"Snake       : What?",
"Snake       : Metal Gear!?  It can't be!",
"Snake       : We've had a couple of run-ins in the past.  So that's the reason              you were here at this disposal site?",
"Snake       : I had heard the Metal Gear project was scrapped.",
"Snake       : Revolution... ?",
"Snake       : Rex?",
"Guard       :  Hey! Sut up in there willya!",
"Snake       : But I thought that all nuclear watheads were equipped with safety              measures.  Some kind of detonation code that you have to input.",
"Snake       : There are two passwords?",
"Snake       : Baker?  The president of ArmsTech?",
"Snake       : You talked?",
"Snake       : Psycho Mantis?",
"Snake       : ...This is bad...",
"Snake       : If they find out Baker's password...",
"Snake       : What?",
"Snake       : And if I do that?",
"Woman       : That card key... ?",
"Snake       : So where are the keys?",
"Snake       : Okay three card keys.  Do you know where they mught be keeping              Baker?",
"Snake       : 2nd floor basement?",
"Snake       : Any other clues?",
"Snake       : Personal Area Network, huh?",
"Snake       : And the doors will open automatically, gotcha.  OK.  I'm going to              get you out of here.",
"Snake       : What is it?",
"Snake       : No.",
"Snake       : I just said no.",
"Snake       : That's their problem.  It has nothing to do with my orders.",
"Snake       : Pentagon?",
"Snake       : What is it!?",
"Woman       : What's that!?  Hey! What happened!?",
"Snake       : Hmmmm... dead.",
"Snake       : Naomi!  The chief! What happened?",
"Naomi       : I... I don't know.  It looked like a heart attack but...",
"Campbell    : A heart attack?  No...",
"Snake       : ...Colonel, are you hiding something from me?",
"Campbell    : Absolutely not.  Snake, you've got to understand.  This op is              security level Red.  You need the highest security clearance to              get access to the complete file.",
"Snake       : You want me to believe that you are in charge of this op, but              you don't have access to the complete file!?",
"Campbell    : I told you.  The Secretary of Defense is in operational control.              I'm just here as your support.",
"Snake       : ........",
"Campbell    : Snake, we don't have time to debate.  get out of there and find              President Baker!",
"Woman    : Don't move!  So you killed the Chief.  You bastard!",
"Woman    : Liquid!?  No... you're not.",
"Woman    : Don't move!",
"Snake    : Is this the first time you've ever pointed a gun at a person?  Your           hands are shaking.",
"Woman    : !!!",
"Snake    : Can you shoot me, rookie?",
"Woman    : Careful, I'm no rookie!!",
"Snake    : Liar!  That nervous glance... that scared look in your eyes. They're           rookie's eyes if I ever saw them.  You've never shot a person, am I           right?",
"Woman    : You talk too much.",
"Snake    : You haven't even taken the safety off, rookie.",
"Woman    : I told you I'm no rookie!!!",
"Snake    : You're not one of them are you?",
"Woman    : Open that door!  You've got a card don't you!?",
"Snake    : Why?",
"Woman    : So we can get the hell out of here.",
"Snake    : Looks like we'll be a little delayed.  What are you doing!?  Don't           think!  Shoot!",
"Woman    : Thanks for the help.",
"Snake    : Wait! Who are you?",
"First man  : You fool!  You've killed him!!",
"Second man : I'm sorry, Sir.",
"Third man  : ...His mental shielding was very strong.  I could not dive             into his mind.",
"First man  : Now we'll never get that detonation code...",
"Third man  : Boss, I have a good idea.",
"Snake      : Uuufff!!  Damn!!",
"Third man  : Good girl. Just like that...",
"Snake    : Naomi, I just had some kind of hallucination.  Is it from the           nanomachines?",
"Naomi    : No Snake.  The nanomachines are funtioning properly.",
"Snake    : So what was it?",
"Naomi    : It must have been psychometric interferance coming from Psycho           Mantis.  FOX-HOUND's psychic.  Think of it as a mental feedback           loop.",
"Snake    : So that was Mantis...?",
"Snake    : Am I too late?",
"Baker    : Oooooo.....  Huhuuhuhuh.....",
"Snake    : He's alive.  You're the ArmsTech president Kenneth Baker, right?           Don't worry, I'm here to save you.",
"Baker    : Noooo!  Don't touch it...",
"Snake    : C4!",
"Ocelot   : Right.  Touch that wire and the C4 will blow up along with the           old man!  So you're the one the Boss keeps talking about.",
"Snake    : And you?",
"Ocelot   : Special Operations FOX-HOUND.",
"Ocelot   : Revolver Ocelot.  I've been waitng for you, Solid Snake.  Now we'll           see if the man can live up to the legend!",
"Ocelot   : This is the greatest handgun ever made.  The Colt Single Action           Army.",
"Ocelot   : Six bullets.  More than enough to kill anything that moves. Now I'll           show you why they call me... 'Revolver'.",
"Ocelot   : Draw!",
"Ocelot   : Just what I'd expect from the man with the same code as the boss.           It's been a long time since I've had such a good fight but I'm just           getting warmed up.",
"Ocelot   : What!  My hand!!!",
"Baker    : Aaaaaaahhh!!",
"Ocelot   : Uuuunnhh!  Ooooof!  Stealth Camouflage, can't you even die right!?           You were lucky, we'll meet again!",
"Snake    : Who are you!?",
"Ninja    : I'm like you... I have no name.",
"Baker    : Ohhh... ohhhh!  That... that exoskeleton...!",
"Ninja    : Ggggyyyaaaaaaahhh!!!  Ggggyyyyaaaaaaaahhh!!!           Gggggyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!",
"Snake    : Who the hell!?",
"Snake    : Can you talk?",
"Baker    : Who are you?",
"Snake    : I'm not one of them.  The DARPA Chief told me he gave them his           detonation code.  What about yours?",
"Baker    : Oh, I get it.  Jim sent you... You... you're from the Pentagon.",
"Snake    : Answer my question!  What about your code!?  There's no time!",
"Baker    : I... talked.",
"Snake    : What! Now the terrorists have both codes and can launch anytime!",
"Baker    : It's not like I didn't fight.  I managed to resist Psycho Mantis's           mind probe.",
"Snake    : He couldn't read you?  How'd you do it?",
"Baker    : Surgical implants in my brain.",
"Snake    : Surgical implants?",
"Baker    : Kind of like a psychic insulation.  Everybody who knows these           top-secret codes has it.",
"Snake    : Even the DARPA Chief?",
"Baker    : Of course.",
"Snake    : But the DARPA Chief said Mantis got his code by reading his mind.",
"Baker    : Are you sure you heard him right?",
"Snake    : Yeah, I'm sure.  In that case, how did they get your code?",
"Baker    : I never had any training on how to resist torture...",
"Snake    : It looks like he had some fun with you all right.",
"Baker    : He's not human.  I tell you, he loved every second of it.",
"Snake    : What happened to your arm?",
"Baker    : He broke it.",
"Snake    : Looks like you're more than even now.  His was sliced off.",
"Baker    : Ha. You're a funny man.  ...So... the DARPA Chief... is he okay?",
"Snake    : Dead.",
"Baker    : What!?  It can't be!  You know that's not what you promised, Jim!           Now you want to shut me up!",
"Snake    : Calm down!  What's wrong with you?  I just told you I was here to           save you!  I didn't kill the DARPA Chief.  He had a heart attack or           something.",
"Baker    : A heart attack? Oh, don't be a fool.",
"Snake    : Anyway, the terrorists have both codes now.",
"Baker    : Those boys are totally insane.  They wouldn't hesitate to launch.",
"Snake    : I agree.  But what do they really want?",
"Baker    : Who knows.  Maybe they're like us in the arms industry... always           looking forward to the next good war.",
"Snake    : Well I'm not going to let these maniacs start a war toady.  Do you           still have the card keys.",
"Baker    : Card keys?",
"Snake    : To override tge detonation codes!  I heard you had them...",
"Baker    : No, not anymore.",
"Snake    : What!?  Who does then!?  Not the terrorists!?",
"Baker    : No, that woman.",
"Snake    : Woman!?  Who!?",
"Baker    : A soldier that was thrown in prison along with me.",
"Snake    : A female soldier?  It must be...",
"Baker    : She said that she had just joined up as a new recruit.  She said           they threw her in prison because she refused to take part in the           rebellion.",
"Snake    : A new recruit?  Could that be the Colonel's niece!?",
"Baker    : I gave her the key.  Looks like she managed to break out of here           though. I hope she's okay.",
"Snake    : I'm sure she is.  She's green... but as tough as they come.  But           how did you know she escaped?",
"Baker    : I was in contact with her by Codec.  Until I was tied up here           that is.",
"Snake    : Codec?",
"Baker    : Yes.  She stole it from the guard.  If she still has it, you           should be able to contact her.",
"Snake    : I'm sure she still has it.  What frequency was she at?",
"Baker    : Oh yeah.  Let me tell you.  It's...",
"Snake    : Huh?",
"Baker    : ...Oh... sorry... I forgot...",
"Snake    : Damn!",
"Baker    : Oh that's right!  It should be on the back of the CD case.  Try to           contact her.",
"Snake    : I'll contact her right away.  But tell me... If this doesn't work,           is there some other way to prevent the missile launch?",
"Baker    : Hmmm.  You need to find Hal Emmerich, one of my employees.",
"Snake    : Who's that?",
"Baker    : The team leader of the Metal Gear Rex project.  A genius at           engineering, but a little bit of an oddball.  If there is anyone who           can figure out how to stop Metal Gear from launching, it's him.",
"Snake    : What if he can't come up with anything?",
"Baker    : You'll have to destroy it.  Emmerich knows how to destroy Metal           Gear.",
"Snake    : Where is this Emmerich?",
"Baker    : Well... he's probably being held somewhere in the Nuclear Warhead           Storage Building.  It's north from here.  That's where he worked.",
"Snake    : I understand, but... why Metal Gear?  The Nuclear Age ended with the           turn of the millenium.",
"Baker    : You're wrong.  The threat of nuclear war isn't gone... in fact           it's greater than it's ever been.",
"Baker    : The amount of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium is increasing even           today.  Listen, have you ever seen a warehouse full of nuclear           material?",
"Snake    : ...No.",
"Baker    : Drums and drums of nuclear waste stacked this high.  As far as           you can see because there's still no real way to dispose of the           stuff.",
"Snake    : So they just close the lid and pretend like it'll go away?",
"Baker    : Essentially, yes.  And they're not even doing a good job of storing           it.  Many of the drums are corroded... with nuclear waste seeping           out of them.",
"Snake    : Unbelievable.",
"Baker    : Not only that, several pounds of MUF are reported every year.",
"Snake    : MUF?",
"Baker    : It stands for 'material unnacounted for'. It proves that there           is a large and well organized black market in nuclear materials.           Furthermore, since the end of the Cold War, Russian nuclear           engineers, in particular, are out of work with nowhere to turn.",
"Baker    : In other words, there is plenty of nuclear material and scientists           for making a bomb.  We live in an age when any small country can           have a nuclear weapons program.",
"Snake    : What about the other superpowers?",
"Baker    : Russia and China still maintain a signifigant nuclear presence.           Complete nuclear disarmament is an impossibility.  To maintain our           own policy of deterrance, we need a weapon of overwhelming power.",
"Snake    : You mean Metal Gear.",
"Baker    : You know our industry suffered quite a blow as a result of the           cut-backs in military budgets, due to this so called 'peace'.",
"Snake    : I remember hearing a lot about mergers and take-overs among the           big weapons makers.",
"Baker    : Yes.  And after my company lost their bid to produce the Air Force's           next fighter jet, the Metal Gear project was out last ace in the           hole.  That's why we pushed to have Metal Gear developed as a           black project.",
"Snake    : Black project?",
"Baker    : Secret projects paid for by the Pentagon's black budget.  You can           avoid a lot of red tape a get a great lead-time on your weapons           production.  And no one can bother you.  Not even those bleeding           heart liberals on the military oversight committee.",
"Snake    : Bribes.",
"Baker    : I prefer to think of it as good buisness.  Anyway, Metal Gear was           going to be formally adopted after the results of this exercise           were analyzed.",
"Snake    : I don't give a crap about you and your company.",
"Baker    : Yes, that's about what I'd expect from a grunt like you... Here,           this is what you came for, right?",
"Snake    : What's that?",
"Baker    : An optical disk.  It's all here.  The main hard drive was destroyed           by gunfire.  This is the only remaining copy of the data.",
"Snake    : What kind of data?",
"Baker    : All the data collected from this exercise.  Don't play dumb.  I           know you were sent to get this.  I hid it from that sadistic maniac           while he was torturing me.  They don't know that this disk exists.           Make sure that you report this to Jim... to your boss.  I'll give           you my card too.  It'll open up all level two security doors.",
"Snake    : Can you walk?",
"Baker    : ...No ...You go on without me.  They got my password... they don't           want anything else from me.",
"Snake    : I have one more question.  Who or what was that ninja thing?  It           looked like you knew something.",
"Baker    : That ninja?  That was FOX-HOUND's dark little secret.",
"Snake    : Dark little secret?",
"Baker    : An experimantal... genome... soldier...",
"Snake    : You know him?",
"Baker    : You should ask Dr. Naomi Hunter from FOX-HOUND.  She knows better           than I.",
"Snake    : Naomi?",
"Baker    : You've got to stop them.  If it goes public, my company and I are...           finished.",
"Snake    : What?  Doesn't Metal Gear use currently existing technology?",
"Baker    : Metal Gear itself does, but...",
"Snake    : Huh!?",
"Baker    : What... what did you do to me!?  Uh... oooh...no!  ...Ooh.  Oh no,           it can't be! ...those Pentagon bastards!  ...So they...they actually           went ahead and did it!",
"Snake    : What are you talking about!?",
"Baker    : They... they're just... using you for... uuuhhh...",
"Snake    : What the hell?",
"Snake    : Colonel!  Are you listening?  Now he's dead too!",
"Campbell : ...I have no idea!",
"Snake    : Don't lie to me!",
"Naomi    : It looked like another heart attcak but...",
"Snake    : Some kind of poison!?",
"Naomi    : Well, there are a lot of drugs that can cause a heart attack in           large doses.  For example. potassium chloride or dioxides... But...           we won't be able to tell without doing an autopsy.",
"Snake    : Damn!",
"Campbell : Snake, I want you and Meryl to work together!",
"Snake    : Can I trust her?",
"Campbell : ...More than you can trust me.",
"Snake    : ......",
"Campbell : Get in contact with her.",
"Mei Ling : Snake, there is a lot of electrical interferance coming from there.           It should be okay if you do burst transmission like us but normal           transmission is probably impossible.  Try moving away from that           area.",
"Campbell : Snake, get a hold of yourself.",
"Snake    : Naomi, what the hell was that ninja thing?",
"Naomi    : .....",
"Snake    : A member of FOX-HOUND?",
"Naomi    : No...",
"Snake    : Are you sure?",
"Naomi    : Yes, we have no one like that in our unit.",
"Snake    : Is that right?",
"Campbell : Snake, I'm counting on you.",
"Meryl    : Who are you?",
"Snake    : I was really impressed with the way you busted yourself out of           there.",
"Meryl    : The one from the prison?",
"Snake    : You're the Colonel's niece, Meryl, right?",
"Meryl    : ....No... it's not him... Just exactly who are you?",
"Snake    : I'm the fool that your uncle sent all alone into the middle of this           whole mess.",
"Meryl    : You came by yourself?  You think you're some kind of one-man army?           You're not even armed.",
"Snake    : I appreciate your help from before.  But... I don't need lectures.           You're just like your uncle, you know.",
"Meryl    : How do you know my uncle?",
"Snake    : We go way back.",
"Meryl    : What's your name?",
"Snake    : My name's not important.",
"Meryl    : Aha!  Could you be Snake?  Are you Solid Snake?",
"Snake    : That's what some people called me.",
"Meryl    : The legendary Solid Snake...!  You!?  Sorry about before.  I wasn't           sure if you were one of the good guys.",
"Snake    : But I knew you were.",
"Meryl    : How?",
"Snake    : It's your eyes.",
"Meryl    : My eyes?",
"Snake    : They're not soldiers eyes.",
"Meryl    : They're rookie's eyes, right?",
"Snake    : No, they're beautiful compassionate eyes.",
"Meryl    : Just what I'd expect from the legendary Solid Snake.  You trying           to sweep me off my feet?",
"Snake    : Don't worry.  You'll land back on them once you meet me.  The           reality is no match for the legend, I'm afraid.",
"Meryl    : I don't believe that.",
"Snake    : Why did you look surprised when you saw my face?",
"Meryl    : Because you look just like him.",
"Snake    : ...You mean the terrorists leader, Liquid Snake?",
"Meryl    : Yeah, you know him?  You're not brothers are you!?",
"Snake    : I have no family.",
"Meryl    : So, what's the deal then?",
"Snake    : Who knows.  Why don't you ask him?  But first I want some           information.  You were involved in this excercise from the           beginning. What exactly happened here?",
"Meryl    : I'm sorry.  I was captured along with President Baker right after           the terrorist attack.",
"Snake    : That's okay.  But what is this place?  I don't think it is just a           nuclear wepaons disposal facility...",
"Meryl    : Boy oh boy... it's just like them!  Nobody told you anything, did           they?  Okay... you see, this place isn't really for disposing           nuclear weapons.  This base is owned and operated by a dummy           corporation of ArmsTech.",
"Snake    : This is a civilian base?",
"Meryl    : Right.  For the development of Metal Gear.",
"Snake    : Colonel!",
"Meryl    : FOX-HOUND and the Next-Generation Special Forces were called           here for the test launching of a dummy nuclear warhead.",
"Snake    : Why FOX-HOUND?",
"Meryl    : Because they're a Special Ops group used to handling top secret           missions.  They figured they could keep it all hush-hush.",
"Snake    : But we must have fired nuclear warheads before.  Why just this time?",
"Meryl    : I heard it was because this was to be a final test before the formal           adoption of the Metal Gear program... that's what I heard anyway.",
"Snake    : Hmmm... sounds kind of fishy...  So what do you think the terrorists           want?",
"Meryl    : Sorry, I'm not sure.  I was captured with President Baker right           after the revolt started.",
"Snake    : Oh yeah, that's when he gave you the detonation override keys,           right?",
"Meryl    : That's right.",
"Snake    : Amazing you were able to keep 'em hidden from the guards.",
"Meryl    : Well... women have more hiding places than men.  Anyway, you met           up with Baker, huh?  How's he holding up?",
"Snake    : He's dead...",
"Meryl    : What!?",
"Snake    : Heart attack.  Same as the DARPA Chief.",
"Meryl    : The Chief died from a heart attck too?",
"Snake    : Yeah, was either of them sick or anything?",
"Meryl    : No, not that I heard of.",
"Snake    : Well, I don't believe in coincidences.  Something funny's going on.",
"Meryl    : Hmmm.  Sounds like it. But I have no idea what.",
"Snake    : Me neither... yet.  Do you know the person who designed Metal Gear?",
"Meryl    : You mean Dr. emmerich?",
"Snake    : Yes.  Is he still alive?",
"Meryl    : Probably.  he should be in the second floor basemant of the Nuclear           Warhead Storage Building to the north.",
"Snake    : Second floor basement?",
"Meryl    : Yeah, that's where his lab is.  I think they're forcing him to work           on the nuclear launching program.",
"Snake    : So they'll need him alive until that's done anyway.",
"Meryl    : Then we'd better do something before he finishes.",
"Snake    : You're right.  In case we can't override the detonation code in time, I           need to ask him how to destroy Metal Gear.",
"Meryl    : You plan to take that thing on by yourself, Snake?",
"Snake    : It won't be the first time...",
"Meryl    : .........",
"Snake    : What's the best way to get to the building where the Doctor is being           held?",
"Meryl    : There's a cargo door on the first floor of this building that           leads to the north.",
"Snake    : What's the security level of the door there?",
"Meryl    : Five, but it's okay... I've got a level five card.",
"Snake    : Well, I've got to go save the Doctor.  You should go...",
"Meryl    : I'm going with you!",
"Snake    : No way!  You're still too green.  I want you to hide somewhere.",
"Meryl    : I'm not green.",
"Snake    : Oh yes you are.",
"Meryl    : ..........",
"Snake    : You pause for just one second in front of your enemy and it's           all over!  Good luck doesn't last forever!",
"Meryl    : I don't know what happened.  I just couldn't pull the trigger           right away.  I never had any problems in training... But when I thought           about my bullets tearing through those soldiers' bodies, I hesitated.",
"Snake    : Shooting at targets and shooting at living, breathing people           are different.",
"Meryl    : Ever since I was a little girl, I always dreamed of being a           soldier.  Every day of my life, I've trained my mind and my body for           the one day when I could finally see some real action, and now",
"Snake    : So what now?  You wanna quit?",
"Meryl    : I can't quit.  I can't alow myself to quit now.",
"Snake    : Listen, Meryl.  Everybody feels sick the first time they kill           someone.  Unfortunately, killing is one of those things that gets           easier the more you do it.  In a war, all of mankind's worst emotions,           worst traits come out. It's easy to forget what a sin is in the middle           of a battlefield.",
"Meryl    : But this isn't a war.  It's a terrorist action.",
"Snake    : You're just a little jumpy from the combat high.  The adrenaline           in your blood is starting to whin out.  Just take it easy.",
"Meryl    : But I learned all about combat high at the academy...",
"Snake    : We'll talk about it later.  For now, just think about keeping           yourself alive.",
"Meryl    : If I get out of here alive, I'll think about that other stuff.",
"Snake    : Okay, let me try to say this another way... Stay the hell out of my way.",
"Meryl    : You're a real bastard, just like my uncle said.",
"Snake    : Ha ha, I told you.  The real me is no match for the legend.",
"Meryl    : It looks like you were right.  Okay Snake, I'll be a good girl.",
"Snake    : We'll link up after I grab the Doctor.  Then we'll take care of the           detonation code override.",
"Meryl    : Got ya.  But listen, I know this area better than you.  Call me if you           have any questions.",
"Snake    : Be careful, okay?",
"Meryl    : After I open up the cargo door, I'll contact you.",
"Meryl    : Snake, I unlocked the cargo door for you.",
"Snake    : Thanks.  Where are you?",
"Meryl    : Where I can see ya.",
"Snake    : Don't move around too much.",
"Meryl    : Don't worry, I'm disguised in this enemy uniform.",
"Snake    : You won't be for long with the way you walk.",
"Meryl    : What does that mean?",
"Snake    : Oh... nothing.",
"Meryl    : Listen Snake, the cargo door is like an airlock.  It's equipped           with infrared sensors.  Be careful.  If an intruder is sensed, gas is           released.",
"Snake    : Gas...",
"Meryl    : Okay, so we'll meet at the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building.",
"Snake    : Wait!  You said you'd stay put and be a good girl!",
"Meryl    : I changed my mind.",
"Snake    : Don't get careless.  That is when things always turn sour.",
"Meryl    : Sorry, but this is the only way I can figure out whether or not           I'm cut out to be a soldier... I gotta get my hands dirty.",
"Snake    : These guys are proffesionals.  You're gonna get yourself killed.",
"Meryl    : See ya there!",
"Snake      : Who are you?",
"Snake      : Deepthroat?  The informant from the Watergate scandal?",
"Deepthroat : Never mind about that.",
"Snake      : You're not using burst transmission.  Are you nearby?",
"Deepthroat : Listen.  There's a tank in front of your position waiting to             ambush you.",
"Snake      : Who are you anyway?",
"Deepthroat : One of your fans.",
"Raven    : This is Raven's territory...",
"Raven   : Snakes don't belomg in Alaska, I will not let you pass.  Send him a          message!",
"Raven   : Ha ha ha ha ha... That's right, you belong on the ground.  You          should crawl on the ground like the Snake you are.",
"Raven   : Come.  Let's fight!",
"Raven        : Well, Boss.  I hope you are happy.  He got the card.",
"Man on Radio : ...We'll play with him a little longer...",
"Raven        : You would be wise not to underestimate him.",
"Man on Radio : What did you think of him?",
"Raven        : He is just as you said.  In battle he is as if possessed by a               demon.  Much like you.  I would expect no less.",
"Ocelot       : You see?  I told you so.  But I will kill him.",
"Raven        : So, General Ivan, I hear he took your hand as well as your               dignity.",
"Ocelot       : Watch your toungue, Shaman!",
"Raven        : In the language of the Sioux people, 'Sioux' means snake.  It               is known as an animal to be feared.",
"Ocelot       : Well, Snake is mine now...  When I meet him next, I'll take               special care of him.",
"Man on Radio : Not yet... Don't kill him yet...",
"Raven        : He and I will meet again in battle.",
"Ocelot       : Same prediction as always?",
"Raven        : Yes.  The raven on my head... it thirsts for his blood.",
"Campbell : Be careful.  You absolutely must not use weapons in that area.",
"Naomi    : I've already programmed the nanomachines so that he won't be able           to, Colonel.",
"Snake    : What?  What are you talking about?",
"Naomi    : Have you forgotten?  That's where they keep the nuclear warheads.           Can't you see them?",
"Snake    : Yeah.  There's lots of boxes piled up here, but... are they all           warheads?",
"Campbell : Yes.  They're all dismantled warheads.",
"Snake    : They just leave them here?  It's like President Baker said...           totally careless.",
"Campbell : They're working on a limited budget.  They try to put on a pretty           face for the media, but this is the grim reality of it.  Nastasha           knows lots more than I do.  Her frequency is 141.52.",
"Naomi    : All of the warheads in those boxes have had their detonation           mechanisms removed so there's no fear of them exploding.  But is           the warheads are broken they might leak plutonium and that would           be a serious problem.",
"Campbell : Snake, you must never use your weapon on that floor.",
"Deepthroat : Snake!  Watch out!  That place is filled with gas.  Also, the             floor is electrified.  First destroy the high voltage switch. Its             the switchboard on the northwest wall.",
"Snake      : But how?  I can't reach it.",
"Deepthroat : Use a remote-controlled missile.",
"Snake    : It looks like they were cut by some type of blade.",
"Guard    : It's... it's a ghost!  Uuurgh!",
"Scientist : Stealth camouflage?  Who are you?",
"Ninja     : Where is my friend?",
"Scientist : What... what are you talking about?",
"Scientist : What next?",
"Ninja     : Snake!!",
"Snake     : You're that ninja.",
"Ninja     : I've been waiting for you, Snake.",
"Snake     : Who are you?",
"Ninja     : Neither enemy nor friend.  I am back from a world where such            words are meaningless. I've removed all obstacles.  Now you and I            will battle to the death.",
"Snake     : What do you want?",
"Ninja     : I've waited a long time for this day.  Now I wanto to enjoy the            moment.",
"Scientist : What... what's with these guys? It's like one of my Japanese            animes...",
"Ninja     : I've come from another world to do battle with you.",
"Snake     : What is it? Revenge?",
"Ninja     : It is nothing so trivial as revenge.  A fight to the death with            you.  Only in that can my soul find respite.  I will kill you or            you will kill me... it makes no difference.",
"Scientist : Waaaaaaaaahhhhhh!",
"Ninja     : Hah! Fine!  He can watch from inside there.",
"Snake     : I need that man.  Keep your hands off him.",
"Ninja     : Now Snake.  Make me feel alive again.",
"Ninja     : I felt that, Snake... Do you remember me now?",
"Snake     : It can't be!  You were killed in Zanzibar...",
"Ninja     : Eeeeeyaaaaaah!",
"Snake     : What!?  Not again!!",
"Ninja     : The... the mediciiiiine!",
"Snake     : What's happening?",
"Ninja     : ...I...I... I'm losing myself...",
"Scientist : Is it over?",
"Ninja     : Waaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!!",
"Snake    : Grey Fox... Colonel, that ninja is Grey Fox.  No doubt about it.",
"Campbell : Rediculous!  You of all people should know he died in Zanzibar.",
"Naomi    : No, he should have died... but he didn't.",
"Campbell : What!?",
"Naomi    : It happened before I joined FOX-HOUND's medical staff.  They were           using a soldier for their gene therapy experiments.",
"Campbell : I never heard that.",
"Naomi    : It happened right after you retired.  My predecessor, Dr. Clark,           was in charge.",
"Campbell : Dr. Clark...",
"Naomi    : Yes.  He started the gene therapy project.",
"Snake    : And where is he now?",
"Naomi    : He was killed in an explosion in his lab two years ago.",
"Snake    : And what about this soldier?",
"Naomi    : Apparently for their test subject, they decided to use the body           of a soldier who was recovered after the fall of Zanzibar...",
"Snake    : And that was Grey Fox...",
"Campbell : But he was already dead...",
"Naomi    : Yes.  But they revived him.  They fitted him with a prototype           exoskeleton and kept him drugged for four years while they           experimented on him like a plaything.  Today's genome soldiers were           born from those experiments.",
"Campbell : That's the sickest thing I ever heard.",
"Naomi    : They used him to test all sorts of gene therapy techniques.",
"Snake    : Naomi, why didn't you tell us about this sooner?",
"Naomi    : Because it's confidential information.",
"Snake    : Is that the only reason?",
"Naomi    : ...",
"Campbell : Naomi: What happened to Grey Fox after that?",
"Naomi    : The record says he died in the explosion.",
"Campbell : I see... But even if that ninja is Grey Fox, the question is why?",
"Snake    : From what I could tell, he didn't know who he was.",
"Campbell : Are you saying that he's just a mindless robot?",
"Snake    : I'm not sure, but he seems intent on fighting me to the death.           We'll meet again, I know it.",
"Naomi    : So you'll fight again?  Until you kill him?",
"Snake    : Hmmmmm... I'd rather not, but maybe that's what he wants...",
"Naomi    : ....",
"Snake     : How long are you going to stay in there?",
"Scientist : Huh?  ...are you one of them?",
"Snake     : No, I'm not.  I always work alone.",
"Scientist : Alone?  Are you an Otaku too?",
"Snake     : C'mon, get out.  We can't stay here forver.",
"Scientist : Your uniform is different from theirs.",
"Snake     : You're the Metal Gear shief engineer, Hal Emmerich, right?",
"Emmerich  : You know me?",
"Snake     : I heard about you from Meryl.",
"Emmerich  : Oh.  So you're here to rescue me?",
"Snake     : Sorry, but no.  There's something that I've got to do first.",
"Emmerich  : Oh, well... at least you're not one of them...",
"Snake     : Huh?  Are you hurt?",
"Emmerich  : I'm okay.  I just twisted my ankle a little bit trying to get            away.",
"Snake     : Well, if that's all, it's nothing to worry about. I want to ask            you something.  I need information about Metal Gear.",
"Emmerich  : Huh?  Metal Gear?",
"Snake     : Yeah.  What's Metal Gear really designed for?",
"Emmerich  : It's a mobile TMD.  It's designed to shoot down nuclear missiles,            only for defensive purposes of course.",
"Snake     : Liar!  I already know that Metal Gear is nothing more than a            nuclear-equipped, walking death mobile.",
"Emmerich  : Nuclear?  What are you talking about?",
"Snake     : The terrorists are planning to use Metal Gear to launch a            nuclear missile. You telling me I didn't know?",
"Emmerich : They're going to put a nuclear missile into Metal Gear's           TMD missile module?",
"Snake     : Wrong.  From the beginning, the purpose of this exercise was to            test Metal Gear's nuclear launch capability using a dummy nuclear            warhead.  The terrorists are just continuing the work you started.",
"Emmerich  : No, you're wrong....",
"Snake     : I heard it directly from your boss, Baker.",
"Emmerich  : No... a nuclear missile on Rex?",
"Snake     : ...So you really didn't know?",
"Emmerich  : No. All the armamnet was built by a seperate department and            the president personally supervised the final assembly of the            main unit.",
"Snake     : President Baker?",
"Emmerich  : Yeah.  I was never told exactly what they armed Rex with.            I...I only know it's equipped with a vulcan cannon, laser, and a            rail gun.",
"Snake     : A rail gun you said?",
"Emmerich  : Yeah.  It uses magnets to fire bullets at extremely high            velocities.  The technology was originally developed for the SDI            system and later scrapped.  We were successful in miniaturizing it            in a joint venture between ArmsTech and Rivermore National Labs.            The rail gun is on Rex's right arm.",
"Snake     : Metal Gear's main funtion is to launch nuclear missiles.  You're            sure you're not forgetting something?",
"Emmerich  : It's true that Metal Gear has a missile module on his back            that can carry up to eight missiles.  But are you saying it was            originally meant to carry nuclear missiles?",
"Snake     : Yeah, but that's not all I think.  If Metal Gear fired only            standard nuclear missiles, then they should already have all the            practical data they need.",
"Emmerich  : No... could it be?",
"Emmerich  : Metal Gear's co-developer, Rvermore National Labs, was working on            a new type of nuclear weapon.  They were using NOVA and NIF laser            nuclear fusion testing equipment and supercomputers.",
"Snake     : So they developed a new type of nuclear weapon in a VR testing lab,            huh?",
"Emmerich  : Yes, but, you can't use virtual data on a battlefield.  They would            need actual launch data.",
"Emmerich  : These are some of the supercomputers.  If you link these you can            test everything in a virtual environment.  But it's all just theoretical.",
"Snake     : So this exercise was designed to test the real thing?",
"Emmerich  : What did our president do?  If the terrorists launch that thing...            Damn!! ...Damn!!",
"Emmerich  : I'm such a fool!  It's all my fault...",
"Emmerich  : The truth is... my grandfather was part of the Manhattan Project.            He suffered with the guilt for the rest of his life.  And my            father... he was born on August 6, 1945...",
"Snake     : The day of the Hiroshima bomb... God's got a sense of humour all            right.",
"Emmerich  : Three generations of Emmeich men... We must have the curse of            nuclear weapons written into our DNA.",
"Emmerich  : I used to think I could use science to help mankind. But the one            that wound up getting used was me.  Using science to help mankind.            that's just in the movies...",
"Snake     : That's enough crying.  Pull yourself together!  Where is Metal            Gear?  Where on this base are they keeping it?",
"Emmerich  : Rex is in the underground maintainence base.",
"Snake     : Where is that?",
"Emmerich  : North of the Communications Tower.  But it's a long way there.",
"Snake     : The emergency override system for the detonation code is there            too?",
"Emmerich  : Yeah, in the maintenance base's Control Room.  You better hurry.            If they were planning a launch from the start, then their            ballistic program is probably finished.  And since they haven't            called for me in a few hours, they must not need me.  In other            words, they must be ready to launch.",
"Snake     : Meryl's got the detonation override keys.  We'll link up with her.",
"Emmerich  : If we can't override the launch we'll have to destroy Rex.",
"Emmerich  : I'll show you the way.",
"Snake     : On that leg of yours?  You'll just slow me down.",
"Emmerich  : You'll need me if you're gonna destroy Rex.",
"Snake     : I don't need you.  I just need your brain.",
"Emmerich  : I created Rex. It's my right... my duty to destroy him.",
"Snake     : If you get a chance, try to escape.  When the coast is clear I'll            try to contact you by Codec.",
"Emmerich  : How am I supposed to escape from an island?",
"Snake     : Okay.",
"Emmerich  : So what then?",
"Snake     : I want you to hide somewhere and keep me informed.  You know this            place well, don't you?",
"Emmerich  : Of course I do.  And don't worry.  I've got this.",
"Emmerich  : It's the same stealth technology as the ninja.  FOX-HOUND was            going to use them, but... With this I'll be fine, bad leg and all.",
"Snake     : Good.  But I want Meryl to watch after you too.",
"Snake     : Meryl, the engineer's okay.",
"Meryl     : That's a relief.",
"Snake     : I want you to look after him.  Where are you now?",
"Meryl     : Very close.",
"Guard     : There she is!  Over there!",
"Meryl     : Oh no!  Damn... they've spotted me!!",
"Snake     : Meryl!  What happened!?",
"Snake     : Something's wrong.",
"Emmerich  : Did you hear something?  Wasn't that some kind of music?",
"Snake     : What did she look like?",
"Emmerich  : She... she was wearing the same green uniform as the terrorists.",
"Snake     : A disguise?",
"Emmerich  : She had such a cute way of walking.  She kind of wiggles her behind.",
"Snake     : You were really looking.",
"Emmerich  : Well... she's got a very cute behind...",
"Snake     : Way of walking, huh?",
"Emmerich  : If she's disguised as the enemy, you'll have to contact her when            she's alone, huh?  There's only one place where we can be sure            she's by herself.",
"Snake     : Where's that?",
"Emmerich  : Don't be so dense...",
"Emmerich  : Here, use this security card.  It's security level 4.",
"Snake     : You're not in pain, are you?",
"Emmerich  : Huh?",
"Snake     : You feel okay?  Nothing bothering you?",
"Emmerich  : What's wrong?  Getting all fiendly all of a sudden?",
"Snake     : Oh nothing.... I'm glad you're okay.",
"Emmerich  : You're strange.",
"Snake     : I'm a little nervous.  Everyone else I've saved suddenly dies.",
"Emmerich  : You're bad luck.",
"Snake     : Forget it, Doctor.",
"Emmerich  : Call me, Otacon.",
"Snake     : Otacon?",
"Otacon    : It stands for Otaku Convention.  An Otaku is a guy like me who            likes Japanimation.",
"Otacon    : Japan was the first country to successfully make bipedal robots.            They're still the best today in the field of robotics.",
"Snake     : And Japanese cartoons played some part in that?",
"Otacon    : They did.  I didn't get into science to make nuclear weapons, you            know.",
"Snake     : That's what all scientists say.",
"Otacon    : I became a scientist because I wanted to make robots like the ones            in the Japanese Animes.  Really, it's true.",
"Snake     : Just sounds like a childish excuse to me.",
"Otacon    : You're right.  We have to take responsibility.  Science has always            thrived on war.  The greatest weapons of mass destruction were            created by scientists who wanted to be famous.  But that's all            over now.  I won't take part in murder anymore.",
"Snake     : Whatever.  All I want from you is information.",
"Otacon    : Sure.  I know everything about this whole base.  About this base            or Rex.  Also, with this stealth camouflage, I can sneak in and            out of the armory and mess hall.  If you need ammo or rations,            just tell me and I'll bring them to you.",
"Otacon    : I'm on frequency 141.12.  See ya later.",
"Meryl     : That's the second time I've been able to sneak up on the legendary            Solid Snake.",
"Snake     : You're Meryl?  There's no way you could pass for a man for long.",
"Meryl     : What do you mean?  Hey!  Men aren't allowed in here.",
"Snake     : I had no idea you were so feminine.",
"Meryl     : This is no time to try and hit on me, Snake.  Besides, it's a            waste of time.  When I joined up they gave me psychotherapy to            destroy my interest in men.",
"Snake     : Same smart mouth.  You're Meryl all right.  Are you hurt?",
"Meryl     : Not yet.  After all, I was disguised as a Genome Soldier.",
"Snake     : So why'd you change?  You'd be better off dressed like one of them.",
"Meryl     : I got tired of disguising myself.  The truth is... the uniform            smelled like blood.",
"Snake     : What's that mark?",
"Meryl     : Huh?  Oh, this?  It's a paint tattoo.  It's not real.  I was a            fan of FOX-HOUND way back.  When guys like you and my uncle were            in it.  None of that gene therapy like there is today.  You guys            were real heroes.",
"Snake     : There are no heroes in war.  All the heroes I know are either            dead... or in prison.  One or the other.",
"Meryl     : But Snake.  You're a hero.  Aren't you?",
"Snake     : I'm just a man who's good at what he does.  Killing.  There's no            winning or losing for a mercenary.  The only winners in war are            the people.",
"Meryl     : That's right.  And you fight for the people.",
"Snake     : I've never fought for anyone but myself. I've got no purpose in            life.  No ultimate goal.",
"Meryl     : Come on.",
"Snake     : It's only when I'm cheating death on the battlefield.  The only            time I feel truly alive.",
"Meryl     : Seeing other people die makes you feel alive, huh?  You love war            and don't want it to stop... Is it the same with all great            soldiers throughout history?",
"Snake     : Why didn't you contact me?",
"Meryl     : My Codec was broken.",
"Snake     : Is that all?",
"Meryl     : Shouldn't you just be happy that we met up like this!?  How did            you recognize me in disguise?",
"Snake     : I never forget a lady.",
"Meryl     : So there's something you like about me, huh?",
"Snake     : Yeah, you've got a great butt.",
"Meryl     : Oh, I see.  First it's my eyes, now it's my butt.  What's next?",
"Snake     : On the battlefield you never think about what's next.",
"Meryl     : So Snake... how are the negotiations doing?",
"Snake     : No progress.",
"Meryl     : So, it's all up to you, huh?",
"Snake     : Somebody's got to prevent them from launching a nuclear missile.",
"Meryl     : There are two ways.  Either we destroy Metal Gear, or...",
"Snake     : ...we override the detonation code.  You got the card keys from            Baker?",
"Meryl     : Card keys?",
"Meryl     : You mean this?",
"Snake     : Where are the others?  There should be three keys.",
"Meryl     : This is all I've got.",
"Snake     : Where could the other two be?",
"Meryl     : I have no idea, but they must be somewhere.  If we can't find them            we'll have no choice but to destroy Metal Gear.",
"Snake     : Metal Gear is in an underground maintenance base to the north.",
"Meryl     : Take me too.  I know this place better than you do.",
"Snake     : You'll just slow me down.  You don't have enough battle experience.",
"Meryl     : I won't slow you down.  I promise.",
"Snake     : And what if you do?",
"Meryl     : Then you can shoot me.",
"Snake     : I don't like to waste bullets.",
"Meryl     : Got it.  I'll be careful.  Y'know... I don't use makeup the way            other women do... I hardly ever look at myself in the mirror. I've            always despised that kind of woman.  I always dreamed of becoming            a soldier.  But I was wrong.  It wasn't really my dream.  My            father... he was killed in action when I was younger.",
"Snake     : You wanted to follow in your father's footsteps?",
"Meryl     : Not really.  I thought that if I became a soldier I could            understand him better.",
"Snake     : So are you a soldier yet?",
"Meryl     : I thought I was until today.  But... now I understand.  The truth            is I was just afraid of looking at myself.  Afraid of having to            make my own decisions in life.  But I'm not going to lie to myself            any more.  It's time I took a long, hard look at myself... I want            to know who I am, what I'm capable of.  I want to know why I've            lived the way I've lived until now.  I want to know.",
"Snake     : Take a good look.  You won't get anothert chance for a while. You            should wash your face while you're at it.  This isn't a training            exercise.  Our lives are riding on this.  There are no heroes or            heroins.  If you lose, you're worm food.",
"Meryl     : Yeah.",
"Snake     : Is that FAMAS functional?",
"Meryl     : Unfortunately it's out of ammo.",
"Snake     : Where'd ya' get that Desert Eagle?",
"Meryl     : I found it in the armory.  It's a .50 caliber Action Express.            There was a SOCOM pistol too, but I chose this.",
"Snake     : Hmmm.  So I got a leftover, huh.  Isn't that gun a little big for            a girl.",
"Meryl     : Don't worry, I can handle it.",
"Snake     : C'mon.  Use my .45.",
"Meryl     : Listen, I've used a gun like this since I was 8 years old.  I'm            more comforatble with it than I am with a bra.",
"Meryl     : If we're going to go to the north, we'll have to go through the            Commander's Room on this floor.  The overland route is blocked by            glaciers.  The door to the commander's room is security level            five.  This card will open it.",
"Meryl     : It was inside the pocket of the uniform I was wearing.",
"Snake     : Looks like he must have been guarding someplace important.",
"Meryl     : Okay, let's go.  I know this place better than you.  I'll be            point man.  Follow me.",
"Meryl     : That's strange.  There's no guard.",
"Snake     : What happened to the music?",
"Meryl     : I'll keep a look out.  Make sure you're ready, okay?",
"Meryl     : My head! ...Ooh.  It hurts!",
"Snake     : What's wrong?",
"Meryl     : Don't come here, Snake!",
"Snake     : Are you okay?  What happened?",
"Meryl     : I'm fine.  Let's go.",
"Meryl     : C'mon Mr. FOX-HOUND.  The commander is waiting.",
"Meryl     : Ah!",
"Meryl     : Snake... do you... like me?",
"Snake     : What the!?",
"Meryl     : Do you like me?  Hold me, Snake.",
"Snake     : What's wrong?",
"Meryl     : Hurry... hurry!  Make love to me!!  Snake, I want you!!",
"Snake     : Who's that!?",
"Mantis    : Huh?  You don't like girls?",
"Campbell  : Snake, Meryl's not herself.  Don't use your weapon.",
"Naomi     : It's psycho Mantis.  He's controlling Meryl.  That tune is his            mind control music.",
"Campbell  : Don't use your weapon.  Try to knock her out.",
"Mantis    : Useless woman!",
"Snake     : Optic camouflage, huh?  I hope that's not your only trick.",
"Mantis    : You!  You doubt my power!?",
"Mantis    : Now, I will show you why I am the most powerful practitioner of            psychokinesis and telepathy in the world.",
"Mantis    : No... there's no need for words, Snake.  I am Psycho Mantis.            That's right... this is no trick.  It is true power.",
"Mantis    : It's useless.  I told you... I can read your every thought. Now...            let me read your mind.  No... perhaps I should say your past.",
"Mantis    : Still don't believe me?  Now I'll read more deeply into your soul.",
"Mantis    : You still don't believe me?  I will show you my psychokinetic            power.  Put your controller on the floor.  Put it down as flat as            you can... that's good.  Now I will move your controller by the            power of my will alone!!",
"Mantis    : What do you think now!?  Can you feel my power now!?  The            demonstration is over!!",
"Mantis    : You are powerful indeed, but I know your weak point!",
"Snake     : Meryl.",
"Mantis    : Stand right where he can see you... and blow your brains out!!!",
"Meryl     : Aaah!!",
"Snake     : Stop! Meryl!!",
"Mantis    : Why!?",
"Mantis    : Yes, stand right there and blow your brains out.",
"Snake     : Colonel, your niece is going to be okay.",
"Campbell  : Thanks, Snake. I owe you one.",
"Snake     : Now that Mantis is beaten, Meryl's brainwashing is going to wear            off, right Naomi?",
"Naomi     : Yes.  Why did you go so far out of your way to save her?  For            Campbell's sake... or... maybe it's because you like her?",
"Snake     : I don't want to see any woman die right in front of me.",
"Naomi     : Oh really?  Since when did anybody's death bother you so much?",
"Campbell  : Naomi!  It's true that Snake has killed a lot of people, that            doesn't mean he doesn't have a heart.",
"Snake     : It's okay, Colonel... she's right.",
"Naomi     : .......",
"Mantis    : So... you used the other... I... I wasn't able to read the future...",
"Snake     : A strong man doesn't need to read the future.  He makes his own.",
"Mantis    : Perhaps so... But I will also read your future...",
"Mantis    : To get to Metal Gear's underground maintenance base... you have to            go through that hidden door.  There's a hidden door behind the            bookcase.  The overland route... it's blocked by frozen glaciers.            Go past the communications towers.  Then use the tower's walkway.",
"Snake     : Why are you telling me this?",
"Mantis    : I can read people's minds.  In my lifetime I have read the pasts,            presents, and futures of thousands upon thousands of men and            women.",
"Meryl     : Oh... gross...",
"Mantis    : And each mind that I peered into was stuffed with the same single            object of obsession.  That selfish and atavistic dsire to pass on            one's seed... it was enough to make me sick.  Every living thing            on this planet exists to mindlessly pass on their DNA.  We're            designed that way.  And that's why there is war.  But you... you            are different... You're the same as us.  We have no past, no            future.  We live in the moment.  That's out only purpose.  Humans            weren't designed to bring eachother happiness.  From the moment            we're thrown into this world, we're fated to bring each other            nothing but pain and misery.  The first person who's mind I dove            into was my father's.  I saw nothing but disgust and hatred for me            in his heart.  My mother died in childbirth... and he despised me            for it... I thought my father was going to kill me.",
"Mantis    : That's when my future dissapeared.  I lost my past as well.  When            I came to, the village was engulfed in flames...",
"Snake     : Are you saying you burned your village down to bury your past?",
"Mantis    : I see that you have suffered the same trauma.",
"Mantis    : We are truly the same, you and I... The world is a more            interesting place with people like you in it... I never agreed            with the Boss's revolution.  His dreams of world conquest do not            interest me.  I just wanted an excuse to kill as many people as I            could.",
"Meryl     : You monster!",
"Snake     : Let him talk.  He doesn't have much time left.",
"Mantis    : I've seen true evil.  You Snake.  You're just like the Boss... No,            you're worse.  Compared to you, I'm not so bad.",
"Mantis    : I read her mind as well.",
"Snake     : Meryl's?",
"Mantis    : I saw you there... you have a large place in heart.",
"Snake     : A large place?",
"Mantis    : Yes. A large place.  But I do not know if your futures lie            together.  I have a last request.",
"Snake     : What is it?",
"Mantis    : My mask... put it back on.",
"Snake     : Okay.",
"Mantis    : Like this... other people's thoughts force their way into my mind.            Before I die... I want to be by myself.  I want to be left alone            in my own world.",
"Mantis    : I'll open the door for you.",
"Mantis    : If you want to find your future, go through that door.  This is            the first time I've ever used my power to help someone.  It's            strange... it feels... kind of... nice.",
"Snake     : Let's go, Meryl.",
"Meryl     : I'm sorry...",
"Snake     : Meryl?",
"Meryl     : How could I let Mantis control my mind like that...",
"Snake     : If you're going to doubt yourself, I'll leave you here.",
"Meryl     : You're right.",
"Snake     : Never doubt yourself.  Just let it make you stronger.  Learn            something from it.",
"Meryl     : You're right.  I'm sorry.  I won't do it again.",
"Meryl     : Snake, can I ask you something?",
"Snake     : What!?",
"Meryl     : About what Mantis said... I was just wondering...",
"Snake     : What?  What's the problem now?",
"Meryl     : Oh no... nothing.  So tell me, Snake.  What's your name?  Your            real name?",
"Snake     : Name means nothing on the battlfield.",
"Meryl     : How old are you?",
"Snake     : OLd enough to know what death looks like.",
"Meryl     : Any family?",
"Snake     : No, but I was raised by many people.",
"Meryl     : Is there anyone you like?",
"Snake     : I've never been interested in anyone else's life...",
"Meryl     : So you are all alone.  Just like Mantis said.",
"Snake     : Other people just complicate my life.  I don't like to get            involved.",
"Meryl     : You're a sad, lonely man.",
"Snake     : C'mon... let's go.",
"Meryl     : Okay, I'll take point again.  Follow me.",
"Meryl     : What's wrong, Snake? I thought you were good with dogs?",
"Meryl     : Hold up, Snake!  This place is mined.",
"Snake     : The radar isn't working.  And since we can't use the mine            detector either...",
"Meryl     : Leave it to me...",
"Snake     : How did you know where the mines were?",
"Meryl     : When Mantis dove into my mind, I could see where the mines were placed.            Are you impressed?",
"Snake     : Well... a little bit.",
"Snake     : Meryl!!",
"Meryl     : What is it?",
"Snake     : Meryl, get down!!!",
"Meryl     : Aaaaaahhhh!!",
"Snake     : Meryl!!",
"Meryl     : Aaaaaaaaahhhh!!!",
"Meryl     : Aaaaaaaghhhh!!!",
"Meryl     : Snake.... leave me and run...",
"Snake     : Meryl...",
"Meryl     : I guess... I am a rookie after all...",
"Snake     : Don't worry, Meryl.  It's me they want.",
"Meryl     : Even I know that, it's the oldest trick in the book.  The sniper's            using me for bait to lure you out.",
"Snake     : Damn!!",
"Meryl     : Shoot me, Snake!!",
"Snake     : No!",
"Meryl     : My gun... I can't reach it by myself.",
"Snake     : Don't move!",
"Meryl     : I promised... I wouldn't slow you down!  I... I... I can still            help... I want to help you!",
"Snake     : Quiet down!  Save your strength!",
"Meryl     : I was a fool, I wanted to be a soldier.  But war is ugly...            There's nothing glamorous about it.  Snake, please!  Save            yourself.  Go on living and don't give up on people!  Don't forget            me... Now get out of here!",
"Campbell  : Meryl!  Damn!! Snake, it's a trap!  Sniper's trick to lure you out.The sniper's waiting for you to go and help Meryl so he can pick you off...Don't do it!",
"Naomi     : It must be Sniper Wolf, FOX-HOUND's best shooter.",
"Snake     : Sniper's usually work in pairs, but this one's alone, huh?",
"Naomi     : I know her.  She can wait for hours, days, or weeks, it doesn't            matter to her.  She's just watching and waiting for you to expose            yourself.",
"Snake     : Maybe so, but Meryl can't hold out that long...",
"Naomi     : Snake, can you see Wolf from where you are?",
"Snake     : There's no where to hide between here and the tower... she must be            on the second floor of the tower.",
"Campbell  : If Wolf is in the Communications Tower, she can see you perfectly!            It's the classic sniper's position!!  At that distance you won't            be able to hit her with a standard weapon either!  You'll need a            sniper rifle.",
"Snake     : Colonel!  Take it easy.",
"Campbell  : ......",
"Snake     : I'm going to save Meryl no matter what it takes.",
"Campbell  : Okay, thanks.",
"Naomi     : ......",
"Snake     : What's wrong, Naomi?",
"Naomi     : Nothing... I'm just surprised you're willing to sacrifice            yourself... you've got the genes of a soldier, not a savior.",
"Snake     : Trying to say that I'm only interested in saving my own skin?",
"Naomi     : I wouldn't go that far but...",
"Snake     : I don't know what the hell my genes look like and I don't care. I            operate on instinct.",
"Naomi     : Like an animal?",
"Snake     : I'm going to save Meryl.  I don't need an excuse.",
"Naomi     : Okay...",
"Snake     : And I'm not doing it for someone else either.  I'm going to save            Meryl by myself.  Colonel, don't worry!",
"Campbell  : Snake, thanks.",
"Naomi     : I understand.  I'm sorry.",
"Campbell  : You've got a PSG1?  Hurry up and save Meryl!",
"Guards    : Freeze!!",
"Wolf      : It's hard to miss when you're this close.",
"Wolf      : Toss your weapon over here.  Slowly...",
"Wolf      : You are a fool to come down here.. stupid man!",
"Snake     : A lady sniper, huh?",
"Wolf:       Didn't you know that two thirds of the world's greatest assassins            are women?  Do you want to die now?  Or after your female friend?            Which will it be?",
"Snake     : I'll die after I kill you.",
"Wolf      : Is that right?  Well at least you've got spirit.",
"Wolf      : I am Sniper Wolf and I always kill what I aim at.",
"Wolf      : You're my... special prey.  Got it?",
"Wolf      : I've left my mark on you... I won't forget it.  Until I kill you, you'reall I'll think about.",
"Snake     : Uuuuhh!!",
"Guard     : Take him away!",
"Liquid    : Don't kill him yet. I want him alive.",
"Ocelot    : Leave it to me.",
"Liquid    : I want no more accidents like that DARPA Chief.",
"Wolf      : Yes.  He's my target.  Mine alone.",
"Liquid    : Can you hear me, Solid Snake?",
"Wolf      : He's tougher than I thought...",
"Liquid    : Do you know who I am?  I always knew that one day I would meet            you. The man who stole what was rightly mine... the man who stole            my birthright.  Me? I'm the man you stole everything good from.            And now, after the sacrifice of our brothers... after 30 long            years, finally the two of us meet.  The brother of light and the            brother of dark.",
"Wolf      : Do you need his DNA too?",
"Liquid    : Yes, I want a sample while he's still alive.  We need it to            correct the Genome Soldier's mutations.",
"Wolf      : Then we'll be able to cure them?",
"Liquid    : No.  We still have to get our hands on Big Boss's DNA.",
"Wolf      : Have they given in to our demands yet?",
"Liquid    : Not yet.",
"Wolf      : They won't give in.  They're all hypocrites, every one of them.",
"Liquid    : Is that your opinion as a Kurd?",
"Wolf      : They always put politics first.",
"Liquid    : That's right.  That's why they want to avoid any leak about their            precious new nuclear weapon.",
"Ocelot    : Boss, it looks like our friend is awake.",
"Liquid    : There definitely is a resemblance.  Don't you think, little            brother? Or should I say big brother?  I'm not sure... Anyway, it            doesn't matter.  You and I are both the last surviving 'sons of            Big Boss'.",
"Liquid    : It's me... Really?  Then what?  Those idiots!  All right Raven.            I'll be right there.",
"Liquid    : They're not responding to our demands.  We'll launch the first one            in 10 hours as planned.",
"Wolf      : Damn Americans!!",
"Ocelot    : Looks like you read them wrong.",
"Liquid    : Something's funny... Normally the Americans are the first ones to            the negotiating table.  They must think they've go something up            their sleeves.",
"Ocelot    : So it's come down to it, has it.  We're going to launch that nuke            and ride it all the way into history.",
"Liquid    : I've got to take care of some launch preparations.  You're in            charge here, Ocelot.",
"Ocelot    : What about you?  Wanna stay for the show?",
"Wolf      : I'm not interested.  It's time to feed the family.",
"Ocelot    : So, you prefer your wolves to my show, huh?",
"Liquid    : Ocelot, don't screw up like you did with the Chief.",
"Ocelot    : Yes, I know.  That was an accident.  I didn't think a pencil            pusher like him would be so tough.",
"Liquid    : Well... his mental defenses were reinforced by hypnotherapy.",
"Ocelot    : Boss, what about that ninja?",
"Liquid    : He killed 12 men.  Whoever he is, he's some kind of lunatic.",
"Ocelot    : Bastard took my hand... How could he have gotten in here?",
"Liquid    : Perhaps there's a spy among us... Mantis is dead.  We've also got            to find out what killed Baker and Octopus.  We're shorthanded, so            make this little torture show of yours as short as possible.",
"Ocelot    : Torture?  This is an interrogation.",
"Liquid    : As you wish.",
"Liquid    : See you later, brother...",
"Wolf      : Your woman is still in this world...",
"Snake     : Meryl...",
"Wolf      : Catch you later, handsome...",
"Ocelot    : Once she picks a target, she doesn't think about anything else.            Sometimes she even falls in live with thwm before she kills them.            Finally, just the two of us.  How are you feeling?",
"Snake     : Not bad.  I caught a nice nap on this revolving bed of yours.  Too            bad I was sleeping alone.",
"Ocelot    : Glad to hear that.  This is some bed all right.  I'm about to show            you some of its nicer features...",
"Snake     : Where are my things?",
"Ocelot    : Oh don't worry.  They're all there.  Washington was taking quite            a chance sending you here.  Someone must have had a lot of faith            in your skill.  Huh, carrier boy?",
"Snake     : So, Metal Gear is armed with a new type of nuclear warhead, huh?",
"Ocelot    : Why don't you go ask Campbell for the full story?",
"Snake     : The Colonel?",
"Ocelot    : By the way, you get an optical disk from President Baker, didn't            you?",
"Snake     : What if I did?",
"Ocelot    : Is that the only disc?  There's no other data?",
"Snake     : What do you mean?",
"Ocelot    : There's no copy?  If not, that's fine.",
"Snake     : Is Meryl okay?",
"Ocelot    : She's not dead yet.  Wolf must have been feeling generous.  But if            you want her to stray that way you better start answering my            questions right now.  You were holding one card key.  Where are            the other two?  What's the trick behind that key!?  That weasel of            a president said there's some kind of trick to using the key.",
"Snake     : Hell if I know.",
"Ocelot    : I see.  No problem then.  We're going to play a game, Snake.  And            we'll find out what kind of man we really are.  When the pain            becomes too great to bear just give up and your suffering will            end.  But if you do, the girl's life is mine.",
"Snake     : Looks like I've got a roommate.  The DARPA Chief!?  Whew...what a            stench!",
"Campbell  : Snake, are you okay?",
"Snake     : I've been better.",
"Naomi     : How's Meryl?",
"Snake     : ........",
"Campbell  : ........ Snake, the government has decided not to give in to their            demands.  We're trying to buy some more time.",
"Snake     : C'mon, Colonel.  Why don't you stop playing dumb?  I'm sorry about            Meryl but I want the lies to end now.",
"Campbell  : What are you talking about?",
"Snake     : Metal Gear was designed to launch a new type of nuclear warhead,            wasn't it?",
"Campbell  : !",
"Snake     : You knew it all along, didn't you?",
"Campbell  : .......",
"Snake     : Why did you try to hide it?",
"Campbell  : ...I'm sorry...",
"Snake     : Can't tell the grunts, huh?  ...You've changed a lot.  Metal            Gear... secret advanced nuclear weapons research...  Does the            White House know about this?  How deep does it go?",
"Campbell  : As far as I know, as of yesterday, the President had not  been            briefed about the Rex Project.",
"Snake     : 'Need to know basis', is that the idea?",
"Campbell  : These are sensitive times.  Even sub-critical nuclear tests are            causing quite a stir.",
"Snake     : Plausible deniability, huh?",
"Campbell  : Yes.  And tomorrow the President and his Russian counterpart are            scheduled to sign the Start 3 Accord.",
"Snake     : I get it.  That's the reason for the deadline.",
"Naomi     : That's right, Snake.  And that's why we can't let the terrorist            attack go public.",
"Campbell  : We still haven't even ratified Start 2 or dealt with the issue of            TMDs.  This has to do with the Presodent's reputation and            America's place as the dominant superpower.",
"Snake     : So patriotism is your excuse for circumventing the Constitution?",
"Campbell  : Please, Snake... just stop them.",
"Snake     : Why should I?",
"Campbell  : Because you're the only one who can.",
"Snake     : In that case, tell me the truth about this new type of nuclear            warhead.",
"Campbell  : I told you before.  I don't knwo the details.",
"Snake     : I don't believe you.If the situation is so serious, why don't you            give in to their demands?  Let them have Big Boss's remains.",
"Campbell  : You see...",
"Snake     : Or is there some reason that you can't do that?  Something you            haven't told me about?",
"Naomi     : Publicly, the President has been very vocal in his opposition to            eugenics experiments.  We don't want the existance of the Genome            Army to go public.",
"Snake     : And that's the only reason?",
"Campbell  : .......",
"Snake     : Huh!  The hell with you!",
"Campbell  : I'm sorry.",
"Snake     : The corpse of the DARPA Chief is lying right here next to me.",
"Naomi     : Poor man.",
"Snake     : But it's strange.  He looks and smells like he's been dead for            days. All his blood's been drained out too.",
"Campbell  : Drained!?",
"Naomi     : Maybe to slow down decomposition?",
"Snake     : I have no idea.",
"Naomi     : But the Chief only died a few hours ago, right?",
"Snake     : Right.  But he's already started to decompose.",
"Naomi     : What could it all be about?",
"Snake     : SOmething in his blood that they wanted?",
"Naomi     : I doubt it.  Just the nanomachines and the transmitter.",
"Campbell  : Did the Chief tell them his detonation code?",
"Snake     : I'm afraid so.  It looks like they've got both codes and are            nearly ready to launch.",
"Campbell  : Damn.  Is there any way to prevent it?",
"Snake     : It seems there's some type of emergency override device that can            cancel out the detonation code.  It's a countermeasure that            ArmsTech installed secretly.  You have to unlock it with three            special card keys.",
"Campbell  : And where are those keys?",
"Snake     : I've got one of them.  I don't know where the other two are.            Besides, I'm locked up here.",
"Campbell  : We've got no choice.  Forget about the keys.  Your top priority            now is to destroy Metal Gear itself.  Sorry to lay it all in your            lap, but you're all I've got.  Bust out of there and get to the            Communications Tower.",
"Naomi     : .......",
"Snake     : .......  Naomi, please talk to me.  Say something to take my mind            off the pain.",
"Naomi     : What can I say?",
"Snake     : Anything.",
"Naomi     : I...I'm not a very good talker.",
"Snake     : Please... tell me about yourself.",
"Naomi     : Myself?  That's a tough one...",
"Snake     : Any family?",
"Naomi     : That's not a very happy topic for me.",
"Snake     : I don't have any family.  No wait, there was a man who said he was            my father...",
"Naomi     : Where is he?",
"Snake     : Dead.  By my own hand.",
"Campbell  : Big Boss.",
"Naomi     : What!? Big Boss!?  I had no idea.",
"Campbell  : There was no way you could.  It happened in Zanzibar 6 years ago.            Only Snake and I know the real truth of what happened there.",
"Naomi     : So, is it true?  Was Big Boss really your father?",
"Snake     : That's what he said.  That's all I know.",
"Naomi     : And you were able to kill him, knowing that?",
"Snake     : Yup.",
"Naomi     : How?",
"Snake     : He wanted it.  Besides, some people just need killing...",
"Naomi     : That's patricide.",
"Snake     : Yup.  That's the trauma that Mantis was talking about.  The one            we share in common.",
"Naomi     : Is that why you left FOX-HOUND?",
"Snake     : Let's just say that I needed to be alone for a while and Alaska            was the perfect place...",
"Naomi     : ...Snake... I didn't have a real family either.  Just a big            brother who put me through school.  We weren't even blood-related            and he was much older than me.",
"Snake     : Where is he?",
"Naomi     : He's dead...",
"Snake     : I'm sorry.",
"Naomi     : ...Snake, is there a woman in your life?",
"Snake     : After you've been through as many wars as me, it's hard to trust anyone.",
"Naomi     : Friends?",
"Snake     : Roy Campbell...",
"Campbell  : Huh?  You're still calling me friend?",
"Naomi     : Is that it?",
"Snake     : No, there was another... Frank Jaeger.",
"Naomi     : What!?",
"Campbell  : Big Boss's most trusted lietenant and the only member of FOX-HOUND            to ever recieve the codename 'Fox'.  Gray Fox.",
"Naomi     : ........",
"Snake     : I learned a lot from him.",
"Naomi     : But... didn't you try to kill each other?",
"Snake     : That's true.  We did.  In Zanzibar.  But it was nothing personal.            We were just proffesionals on opposite sides, that's all.",
"Naomi     : And you still call yourselves friends?",
"Snake     : Hard to believe?  War is no reason to end a friendship.",
"Naomi     : That's insane.",
"Snake     : I first met him on the battlefield.  He was being held a prisoner            of Outer Heaven.  But he didn't look like a prisoner to me.  He            was always so cool and precise.  I was still green and he showed            me the ropes.",
"Naomi     : You knew him well?",
"Snake     : No.  We never talked about our personal lives.  Sort of an            unwritten rule.  The nest time I saw him on the battlefield, we            were enemies.  We were fighting barehanded in a minefield.  I know            it sounds strange to most people.  But we were just two soldiers            doing our jobs.  It's like a sport.",
"Naomi     : Men and their games!  You're like wild animals!",
"Snake     : You're right.  We are animals.",
"Naomi     : So if you were friends, then how do you explain the Ninja's behavior?",
"Snake     : I don't know.",
"Naomi     : It's your genes... they make you predisposed towards violence!",
"Snake     : You really like talking about genes, Naomi.  Why did you get into            genetic research anyway?",
"Naomi     : I never knew who my parents were or even what they looked like. I            guess I got into genetics because I wanted to figure out why I'm            the way I am.",
"Snake     : So you studied about DNA?",
"Naomi     : Yeah.  I thought if I studied my genetic structure, I'd find out            who I really was.  I thought that by analyzing a person's genetic            information, I could retrieve the blank spots in that person's            memory.",
"Snake     : Memory is stored in DNA?",
"Naomi     : We're not sure.  But we know that a person's genetic fate is            determined just by the sequence of the four bases in their DNA.",
"Snake     : So what about my fate? You know my DNA sequence, don't you?",
"Naomi     : Your fate?  I...I'm sorry.  I have no idea.",
"Snake     : Of course not.  You're a scientist, not a fortune-teller.",
"Naomi     : .........",
"Snake     : Otacon, are you still okay?",
"Otacon    : Yeah.  Thanks to the stealth camouflage, that is.",
"Snake     : I have a favor to ask.  I need your help.",
"Otacon    : I was wondering when you'd ask.  What should I do?",
"Snake     : I've been captured.  I'm locked up here in this cell.",
"Otacon    : What cell?",
"Snake     : There's a big torture machine nearby.",
"Otacon    : Okay.  I know it.  It's close.  I'll be there right away.",
"Snake     : Thanks.",
"Guard     : Aaachoo!  That witch!  She took my clothes!  Oh... my stomach.",
"Otacon    : Hey! I'm here!",
"Snake     : Where?",
"Otacon    : Here.",
"Otacon    : It's me.",
"Snake     : Otacon!",
"Otacon    : Wow!  They even captured you!",
"Snake     : Hurry!  Get me out of here!",
"Otacon    : Let me go!  That hurts!",
"Snake     : Hurry up!",
"Otacon    : Is that how you ask a guy a favor?  Let me go.  Jeez, it's like            an animal's cage.  ...What a smell!",
"Snake     : Because of him.",
"Otacon    : Eeyaaah!  It's the DARPA Chief!!",
"Snake     : If you don't hurry up and get me out of here, I'll be laying next            to him.",
"Otacon: Those bastards!  This lock won't open up with a security card.  Youneed a key like the soldiers carry.",
"Snake: So what are you doing here then?",
"Otacon: I... I thought you might be hungry.  If you need more food, I can bringsome more later.",
"Otacon: Also, I got this level 6 card, it'll get you out of that torture room.Here... take this too.",
"Snake: What's that.",
"Otacon: It's a hankerchief.  I got it from Sniper Wolf.",
"Snake: Why?",
"Otacon: I don't know why, but she's nice to me.",
"Snake: Sounds like Stockholm Syndrome to me.",
"Otacon: I was taking care of the dogs here.  After the terrorists take over,they were planning to shoot all the dogs.  But Sniper Wolf stopped them... sheeven let me feed them when I asked.  She likes dogs.  She must be a goodperson.  Please don't hurt her.",
"Snake: Wake up you idiot!  She's the one who shot Meryl!",
"Otacon: Well, that's all I can do...",
"Snake: They're planning to launch a nuke!  I've got to stop them!",
"Otacon: Then you'll have to get past the Communications Tower.",
"Snake: First, you have to get me out of here!",
"Otacon: C'mon...I'm trying my best...",
"Snake: That guard's got the key.  You'll have to take him out!",
"Otacon: Gimme a break!  I'm no soldier!  I can't take anybody out!",
"Snake: You have to!!",
"Otacon: I'll be killed!",
"Otacon: Oh jeez.  He's coming back... see ya later...",
"Snake: Wait!",
"Guard: What the hell!",
"Meryl     : Aaaaaaaaahhhh!!!",
"Meryl     : Aaaaaaaghhhh!!!",
"Meryl     : Snake.... leave me and run...",
"Snake     : Meryl...",
"Meryl     : I guess... I am a rookie after all...",
"Snake     : Don't worry, Meryl.  It's me they want.",
"Meryl     : Even I know that, it's the oldest trick in the book.  The sniper's            using me for bait to lure you out.",
"Snake     : Damn!!",
"Meryl     : Shoot me, Snake!!",
"Snake     : No!",
"Meryl     : My gun... I can't reach it by myself.",
"Snake     : Don't move!",
"Meryl     : I promised... I wouldn't slow you down!  I... I... I can still            help... I want to help you!",
"Snake     : Quiet down!  Save your strength!",
"Meryl     : I was a fool, I wanted to be a soldier.  But war is ugly...            There's nothing glamorous about it.  Snake, please!  Save            yourself.  Go on living and don't give up on people!  Don't forget            me...",
"Campbell  : Snake, about Meryl...",
"Snake     : Colonel, I'm sorry...",
"Campbell  : Listen to me.",
"Snake     : I wasn't able to protect her.",
"Campbell  : Snake, it's okay.  You did what you could, now let it rest.",
"Snake     : Colonel...",
"Campbell  : She joined up of her own free will.  I'm sure she was prepared for            this.",
"Snake     : No.  You're wrong.",
"Campbell  : ...?",
"Snake     : Meryl thought she had to become a soldier... thought it was the            only way.  She said she thought it woul;d bring her closer to her            dead father.",
"Campbell  : She said that!?",
"Snake     : She wasn't ready for real combat.  I shouldn't have pushed her so            hard.... It's all my fault.",
"Master    : That's not like you, Snake.",
"Campbell  : Master.  What is it?",
"Master    : Sorry for eavesdropping, but I just couldn't listen anymore.",
"Snake     : Master...",
"Master    : Snake, you can have regrets if you want to... it's only natural.            But you can't keep attacking yourself for things that happened in            the past.  That road leads to madness, believe me.",
"Mei Ling  : He's right.  Don't kick yourself.  It doesn't suit a legend like            you. And besides that, for all we know Meryl's okay, right?",
"Snake     : Mei Ling...",
"Campbell  : Snake, forget about Meryl.  Stop Liquid.  That's what Meryl would            want, too.",
"Snake     : You're right.  Meryl would say the same thing.",
"Naomi     : Snake.",
"Snake     : What?",
"Naomi     : Meryl...she's pretty special to you, huh?",
"Snake     : Yes, she's special.  There aren't many women like her around.",
"Naomi     : That's not what I meant...",
"Snake     : She's the Colonel's niece... and a combat buddy.",
"Naomi     : Is that all?  C'mon...",
"Snake     : This is like a police interrogation.",
"Naomi     : No, I just...",
"Campbell  : I guess it's in the genes...",
"Snake     : The genes?  What are you talking about, Colonel?",
"Campbell  : No, I just remembered about Naomi's grandfather.  I think Naomi            said he rose as high as assisstant secretary in the FBI during            Edgar Hoover's time.",
"Snake     : Is that right?",
"Naomi     : Yes...yes, he was Japanese and he became a special undercover            investigator to nab the mafia.",
"Master    : When was that?",
"Naomi     : Oh.. sometime in the 50's, I guess.",
"Master    : Where?",
"Naomi     : New York, I think...",
"Master    : Naomi, I thought you didn't have any family...",
"Naomi     : Well...I...I researched it after I became an adult.  My            grandfather was already dead by the time I learned about him.  I            never even had the chance to meet him.",
"Campbell  : Oh...",
"Naomi     : Snake, good luck.",
"Campbell  : Watch your back, Snake.",
"Snake     : Damn!",
"Liquid    : Snaaaaake!!  I'm afraid I can't let you get past here!",
"Snake     : Liquid?",
"Liquid    : You're not going any farther.  Die!!!",
"Snake     : It's a long way down. If only I had a rope.  I should be able to            use that rope I got...",
"Liquid    : What are you going to do? Take on a Hind with your bare hands?            Now you're mine!",
"Snake     : If I stay here, I'm finished.",
"Otacon    : Don't shoot!!  It's me! Don't shoot!  It's me, Snake!!",
"Snake     : Otacon? How'd you get here?",
"Otacon    : It wasn't as dramatic as your entrance, believe me. I'm afraid of            heights.",
"Snake     : You were watching?",
"Otacon    : Yeah, I was watching.  I was riding in the back of their truck...            thanks to the stealth camouflage.",
"Snake     : How did you get up here?",
"Otacon    : The elevator, of course.",
"Snake     : The 1st floor of the circular staircase was destroyed.",
"Otacon    : That's why I took the elevator...",
"Snake     : The elevator was working?",
"Otacon    : Yeah, that's right. You're incredible... like a movie hero or            something.",
"Snake     : No...you're wrong.  In the movies, the hero always saves the girl...",
"Otacon    : ...You mean Meryl? ...Sorry... forget I said anything... Snake,            there's something I've really got to ask you. It's why I followed            you up this far...  Have you ever ...loved someone?",
"Snake     : That's what you came to ask?",
"Otacon    : No I mean... I... I was wondering if even soldiers fall in love...",
"Snake     : What are you trying to say?",
"Otacon    : I wanna ask you... Do you think love can bloom even on a battlefield?",
"Snake     : Yeah...I do.  I think at any time, any place... people can fall in            love with each other.  But... if you love someone, you have to be            able to protect them...",
"Otacon    : I think so too.",
"Snake     : I have a favor to ask.",
"Otacon    : Uh oh.",
"Snake     : Don't worry. It'll be easy.",
"Otacon    : Umm...I told you before, I don't wanna hurt anyone.",
"Snake     : I don't want you to either.",
"Otacon    : Okay...",
"Snake     : The elevator is stopped down there. I want you to get it to move.            You see?",
"Otacon    : That's weird.",
"Snake     : It was working before, but now it isn't.",
"Otacon    : ...Maybe the panel's broken?",
"Snake     : Can you fix it?",
"Otacon    : It was working before. If it's the mechanism, leave it to me.",
"Snake     : I've got to go and swat a noisy fly.",
"Otacon    : Okay. I'll stay here and hold the fort.  Good luck.",
"Snake     : You really look like hell. Are you okay?",
"Otacon    : Don't worry.  If I do this, it doesn't matter.  I just pretend            like I'm not here. Then I'm not scared.",
"Snake     : Strange logic. I'm counting on you.",
"Liquid    : So the Snake's finally come out of his hole?  Are you ready now...            my brother?",
"Snake     : Why are you calling me brother?  Who the hell are you!?",
"Liquid    : I'm you.  I'm your shadow.",
"Snake     : What!?",
"Liquid    : Ask the father that you killed! I'll send you to hell to meet him!!",
"Liquid    : C'mon, fly!  Damn!!  Snaaake!!",
"Snake     : See you in hell...Liquid.  That takes care of the cremation.",
"Otacon    : Snake, the elevator's working.",
"Snake     : You fixed it?",
"Otacon    : No, that's the weird thing.  It just moved by itself. It's headed            your way now.",
"Snake     : Is that so? Okay.",
"Otacon    : That explosion before... what was it?",
"Snake     : Oh, I had to take out that helicopter.",
"Otacon    : Helicopter? That's incredible, Snake!",
"Snake     : Listen. I just want to make sure again.  This is the way to get to            where Metal Gear is being stored?",
"Otacon    : Yeah. The entrance to the underground maintenance base is towards            the back of the snowfield ahead.",
"Snake     : Okay. Find a safe place to hide out for a while.  I'm going            underground.",
"Otacon    : I know, I know. You don't have to tell me.",
"Snake     : And stay outta my way. Don't try to be a hero or anything.",
"Otacon    : Okay, call me if you need to.",
"Otacon    : Snake, there's something I forgot to tell you before.",
"Snake     : What?",
"Otacon    : There were five stealth camouflage prototypes in my lab.",
"Snake     : Yeah, so?",
"Otacon    : If you take out the one I'm wearing, that leaves four.",
"Snake     : Hey. This isn't first grade math class.",
"Otacon    : I thought I'd get one for you, so I went back to the lab and...",
"Snake     : Yeah?",
"Otacon    : The four suits were missing.",
"Snake     : .........?",
"Otacon    : Also...about the elevator that I checked out... It's really            strange.  It was like someone was intentionally holding it.",
"Snake     : When you were riding on it, did the weight limit warning go off?",
"Otacon    : That's another thing that bothered me about it... The warning went            off and I know I couldn't be over the limit.",
"Snake     : How much do you weigh?",
"Otacon    : About 135.  But that elevator had a weight limit of 650 pounds.",
"Snake     : It would take at least five people to go over that limit...",
"Otacon    : L...Look out, Snake!  The guys who stole my stealth prototypes are            in there with you!!!",
"Guard     : Too late, Snake!  Now die!",
"Otacon    : Snake!! Are you okay!?",
"Snake     : Otacon! Were there any other stealth prototypes?",
"Otacon    : No. There were only five.",
"Snake     : So...this isn't stealth camouflage then...",
"Otacon    : What are you talking about?",
"Snake     : Someone's aiming at me... in the middle of this blizzard...",
"Otacon    : ...It's her!!",
"Snake     :  Wolf? ...Sniper Wolf?",
"Otacon    : Yes it's her! ...It's definitely her!",
"Snake     : Otacon... You sound like you're happy.",
"Otacon    : No I'm not.",
"Snake     : So then what is it?",
"Otacon    : Snake... please don't kill her!",
"Snake     : Are you insane!?",
"Otacon    : Please. She's a good person! You'd know that if you talked to her...",
"Snake     : Listen to me, kid. She's a merciless killer.",
"Wolf      : I can see you perfectly from here.  I told you... I'd never quit            the hunt. Now you're mine.",
"Otacon    : Wolf! No, you can't!",
"Wolf      : Don't get between a wolf and its prey!",
"Snake     : You're pretty good if you can hit me in this storm.",
"Wolf      : You see?  Women naturally make better soldiers.",
"Otacon    : Wolf! Don't do this!!",
"Wolf      : Snake, I'm near.  Can't you sense me near you?",
"Snake     : It's a mistake for a sniper to reveal her location.",
"Wolf      : Is that right?  Well I'm going to send you a love letter, my dear.            Do you know what that is? It's a bullet straight from my gun to            your heart.",
"Otacon    : Please!!  Wolf!...Snake!...No!",
"Wolf      : Quiet!  Don't get in our way!",
"Snake     : Now I'm gonna pay you back for Meryl...",
"Wolf      : You men are so weak.  You can never finish what you start...",
"Wolf      : I... I've... ...waited for this moment... I am a sniper. Waiting            is my job... Never moving a muscle... concentrating...",
"Wolf      : I am lung-shot. Y...you cannot save me.  Please... Just finish me            quick. I am a Kurd. I have always dreamed of a peaceful place like            this...",
"Snake     : A Kurd? So that's why you're called Wolf...",
"Wolf      : I was born on a battlefield.  Raised on a battlefield. Gunfire,            sirens and screams... they were my lullabies... Hunted like dogs            day after day... driven from our ragged shelters... That... was my            life.  Each morning, I'd wake up... and find a few more of my            family or friends dead beside me.  I'd stare at the morning sun...            and pray to make it through the day. The governments of the world            turned a blind eye to our misery.  But then... he appeared. My            hero... Saladin... he took me away from all that...",
"Snake     : Saladin? ...You mean Big Boss?",
"Wolf      : I became a sniper... hidden, watching everything through a            rifle's scope.  Now I could see war, not from the inside, but from            the outside, ...as an observer... I watched the brutality... the            stupidity of mankind through the scope of my rifle.  I joined this            group of revolutionaries... to take my revenge on the world.            But... I have shamed myself and my people.  I am no longer the            wolf I was born to be... In the name of vengeance, I sold my body            and my soul.  Now...I am nothing more than a dog.",
"Snake     : Wolves are noble animals.  They're not like dogs. In Yupik, the            word for wolf is 'Kegluneq', and the Aleuts revere them as            honorable cousins. They call mercenaries like us 'Dogs of War'.            It's true, we're all for sale at some price or another. But you're            different. ...untamed... solitary.  You're no dog... You're a            wolf.",
"Wolf      : Who are you? ...Are you Saladin?",
"Snake     : Wolf... you spared Meryl's life.",
"Wolf      : She... she was never my real target... I don't kill for sport.",
"Snake     : Rest easy.  You'll die as the proud wolf you are.",
"Wolf      : I finally understand.  I wasn't waiting to kill people... I was            waiting for someone to kill me.  A man like you... You're a hero.            Please... set me free.",
"Otacon    : Why...!?  I loved you...",
"Snake     : What is it?",
"Wolf      : My gun... give it to me...",
"Wolf      : She's part of me.",
"Wolf      : Everyone's here now.  Okay, hero, set me free.",
"Otacon    : Goodbye...",
"Otacon    : Snake, you said that love could bloom on a battlefield... But I            couldn't save her.",
"Otacon    : What are you doing?",
"Snake     : Returning it to it's owner.  I don't need a hankercheif.",
"Otacon    : Why?",
"Snake     : I don't have any more tears to shed.",
"Snake     : I'm going to the underground base.  We're out of time.",
"Otacon    : I know.",
"Snake     : You'll have to protect yourself now.  Don't trust anyone.",
"Otacon    : Yeah...",
"Snake     : If I can't stop Metal Gear, this whoe place will probably be            bombed to hell.",
"Otacon    : ...Yeah...",
"Snake     : We might not meet again.",
"Otacon    : I'll hang onto my Codec.  I wanna keep helping.",
"Snake     : You can leave any time.  Get a headstart... a headstart on your            new life.",
"Otacon    : Snake!!  What was she fighting for?  What am I fighting for!?            What are you fighting for!?",
"Snake     : If we make it through this, I'll tell you.",
"Otacon    : Okay.  I'll be searching too.",
"Master    : Snake, there's something I've got to tell you about Naomi Hunter?",
"Snake     : What about her?",
"Master    : Is this conversation secure?",
"Snake     : Don't worry.  The monitor's off.",
"Master    : Okay.",
"Snake     : What's up?",
"Master    : I was in the FBI too, y'know.",
"Snake     : I didn't know that.  What's your point?",
"Master    : Dr. Hunter's story about her background... about her grandfather            being an assistant secretary to Hoover in the FBI...",
"Snake     : Yeah?",
"Master    : And then going undercover to investigate the mafia in New York...",
"Snake     : Yeah, what about it?",
"Master    : It was all a big lie.",
"Snake     : What did you say?",
"Master    : It was really bothering me.  Why would she lie about it?",
"Snake     : She lied?",
"Master    : She might be a spy!",
"Snake     : Rediculous!",
"Master    : C'mon.  Even a high school student could see past it.  The head of            the FBI at that time, Edgar Hoover... he was a well known racist.            Didn't Naomi say that her father was Japanese?",
"Snake     : Yeah...",
"Master    : Well back then there wasn't a single Asian investigator.  Also,            in the 1950's the undercover mafia sting operations hadn't even            started yet.  They first started in 1960... in Chicago, not New            York.",
"Snake     : But...",
"Master    : You better check it out.  The chief and the president dying, that            ninja... too many strange things are happening.",
"Snake     : Are you saying that Naomi might be behind it?",
"Master    : I don't know.  Either that or she's working with the terrorists.",
"Snake     : Could it be...?",
"Master    : If I find out anything, I'll call.  In the meantime, be careful!",
"Raven     : Welcome, kasack!!  This is the end of the road for you!  Right my            friends?",
"Raven     : Listen.  They agree.  Ravens aren't scavengers like most people            think... They are simply returning to the natural world that which            is no longer needed.  Sometimes they even attack wounded foxes.",
"Snake     : You were the one in the M1 tank?  Must have been a tight fit for            a big boy like you.",
"Raven     : Ha ha ha ha ha... But that was no true battle.",
"Raven     : The ravens and I were testing to see what kind of man you were.            The judgement is decided.  The ravens say you are a true warrior.",
"Snake     : Am I hallucinating?",
"Snake     : I... I can't move...",
"Raven     : The Raven has put the mark of death upon you.  Blood from the east            flows within your veins. Ah... your ancestors too were raised on            the barren plains of Mongolia.  Inuit and Japanese are cousins to            each other...  We share many ancestors, you and I...",
"Snake     : I don't have any crows in my family tree.",
"Raven     : You jest but indeed ravens and snakes are not the best of friends.            Nevertheless you will make a worthy adversary.  You live in Alaska            too.  You know of the World Eskimo-Indian Olympics?",
"Snake     : Yeah, I know it.  You must be a real threat in the 'Muk-Tuk'            eating contest.",
"Raven     : Yes, you are right.  But there is another event that I excel at.  It is            called the 'Ear Pull'.  It is an event where two opponents pull            each other's ear while enduring the harsh cold.  It tests            spiritual as well as physical strength.",
"Snake     : You want to pull each other's ears?",
"Raven     : The form is different, but the spirit is the same.  Rejoice,            Snake! Ours will be a glorious battle.",
"Snake     : This isn't glorious.  It's just plain killing.  Violence isn't a            sport!",
"Raven     : Well, we will see if there is iron in your words!!",
"Raven     : Just as the Boss said... it is my existance wihich is no longer            needed in this world.",
"Raven     : But my body will not remain in this place.  My spirit and my            flesh will become one with the ravens.  In that way I will return            to Mother Earth who bore me.  Snake!  My spirit will be watching            you... understand?",
"Raven     : Snake, take this security card.  It wil open that door.",
"Snake     : Why?",
"Raven     : You are a snake which was not created by Nature.  You and the            Boss... you are from another world... a world that I do not wish            to know.  Go and do battle with him.  I will be watching from            above.  First, I'll give you a hint... The man who you saw die            before your eyes...",
"Raven     : That was not the DARPA Chief.  It was Decot Octopus.  A member of            FOX-HOUND.  He was a master of disguise.  He copied his subjects            down to the blood.  So he drained the Chief's blood and took it            into himself.  But he wasn't able to decieve the Angel of Death.",
"Snake     : The Angel of Death?  But why go to so much trouble?  Why            impersonate the Chief?",
"Raven     : That is the end of my hint.  You must solve the rest of the riddle            yourself.",
"Raven     : In the natural world, there is no such thing as a boundless            slaughter.  There is always an end to it.  But you are different.",
"Snake     : What are you trying to say?",
"Raven     : The path you walk on has no end.  Each step you take is paved with            the corpses of your enemies...  Their souls will haunt you            forever... you shall have no peace... Hear me, Snake!  My spirit            will be watching you!",
"Snake    : Master?",
"Master   : It's about Naomi. Turn your monitor off...",
"Campbell : What about Naomi?",
"Master   : Damn!",
"Snake    : Colonel, is Naomi there?",
"Campbell : No, she's away.  She's taking a short nap.  So what is this about           Naomi?",
"Master   : Okay.  Maybe we'd better let the Colonel hear this too.",
"Snake    : Yeah.  Go on, Master...",
"Master   : Well basically, Dr. Naomi Hunter is not Dr. Naomi Hunter at all.",
"Campbell : What!?",
"Master   : I thought her story about her background sounded a little fishy, so           I checked it out.",
"Campbell : And...?",
"Master   : There is an actual Dr. Naomi Hunter, or I should say there was           one... But she's not the woman we know.  The real Noami Hunter           disappeared somewhere in the Middle East.  Our Naomi must have           somehow gotten her identification papers.",
"Campbell : Then who is she really?",
"Master   : She must be some kind of... spy.",
"Campbell : A spy!?",
"Master   : Yes... maybe she's been sent to sabotage this operation.",
"Campbell : Are you saying she's with the terrorists?",
"Snake    : ...I don't want to believe it either.  But she is working for           FOX-HOUND.",
"Campbell : So you think she had a part in the uprising?",
"Master   : Or she could be working with some different group all together.",
"Campbell : Different group...?  It couldn't be...",
"Master   : Place her under arrest.",
"Campbell : What!",
"Master   : She's betrayed us.  She needs to be arrested and interrogated to           find out who she's with.",
"Campbell : If she's one of their spies, then we're really in big trouble...",
"Snake    : What do you mean!?",
"Campbell : Oh nothing....",
"Master   : Have you let her in on some sort of vital secret or something?",
"Campbell : .........",
"Master   : Does this have anything to do with the mysterious deaths of the           DARPA Chief or the ArmsTech president?",
"Campbell : I... I have no idea.",
"Master   : Anyway, we cannot allow her to participate any further in this           mission.",
"Campbell : Wait, wait a minute.  Without her, we can't complete this mission.",
"Snake    : I knew it.  You're hiding something.",
"Campbell : Give me some time.  I'll try to get it out of her...",
"Master   : Hurry then.  We've got to find out who she is and what she's doing           here.",
"Campbell : I understand.  Snake, give me some time.",
"Snake    : I don't have any time left for you.",
"Otacon   : Snake... it's me.",
"Snake    : What's wrong?  Did you find a good place to hide?",
"Otacon   : Yeah, thanks to the stealth gear.  It looks like they've finished           getting Metal Gear ready.",
"Snake    : How do you know that?",
"Otacon   : I overheard them talking.  Where are you now?",
"Snake    : Right in front of Metal Gear... but it's strange.",
"Otacon   : What is?",
"Snake    : There's nobody here... no guards, nobody patrolling... it's too           quiet.",
"Otacon   : Maybe because they're all ready.  They said they even input the PAL           codes.",
"Snake    : What should I do?",
"Otacon   : All we can do is use the override system that President Baker told           you about.",
"Snake    : But I've only got one of the three keys.  And besides that, like           Ocelot said, there's some trick to using the keys...",
"Otacon   : Leave it to me...",
"Snake    : You got some kind of plan?",
"Otacon   : Well, I'm in the computer roo right now.  I'm trying to access           Baker's private files.",
"Snake    : Baker's files?  Don't you need a password?",
"Otacon   : Of course.  But there are ways...",
"Snake    : Are you a hacker?",
"Otacon   : Yup.  That describes me pretty well.",
"Snake    : Does it look like you can get in?",
"Otacon   : I don't know yet.  I'll give it a try.",
"Snake    : I'm counting on you...",
"Otacon   : It's me again.",
"Snake    : How's it going?",
"Otacon   : Hmmm... not bad.  I just got past his third security level.  He was           a pretty careful guy.",
"Snake    : Do you think you'll break in soon?",
"Otacon   : I've never met a system I couldn't bust into.",
"Snake    : Okay, keep trying.",
"Otacon   : Snake, I did it!",
"Snake    : You got past security?",
"Otacon   : Bingo!!!",
"Snake    : Great.  So whaddya got?",
"Otacon   : I accessed the confidential Metal Gear file.",
"Snake    : So what about the PAL override system that Baker talked about?",
"Otacon   : I haven't found it yet.",
"Snake    : That's what I need to know!",
"Otacon   : But Snake, I found something else!",
"Snake    : What?",
"Otacon   : The secret behind the new nuclear weapon!  Just as I thought, the           nuclear warhead is designed to be fired from the rail gun, like a           projectile... It doesn't use fuel so it isn't considered a missile.           That way it can get around all sorts of international treaties.",
"Snake    : Pretty sneaky.",
"Otacon   : Yes, but effective.  And that's not even the scariest thing about           this weapon.",
"Snake    : I can't wait to hear this.",
"Otacon   : It's a stealth weapon!",
"Snake    : You mean it won't show up on radar?",
"Otacon   : Yeah.  The truth is... they've been working on a stealth missile           since the late 70's.",
"Snake    : Why weren't they able to develope one until now?",
"Otacon   : Because of the missile's rocket propulsion system... it will be           picked up by enemy satellites.",
"Snake    : Oh yeah, that makes sense.",
"Otacon   : But unlike a missile, the rail gun doesn't burn any propellant.  So           it can't be detected by any current ballistic missile detection           systems.",
"Snake    : An invisible nuclear warhead...",
"Otacon   : Totally impossible to intercept.  And on top of that, it's got a           surface piercing warhead designed to penetrate hardened           underground bases.",
"Snake    : We learned that lesson in the Gulf War.",
"Otacon   : This thing could mean the end of the world!",
"Snake    : It's the ultimate weapon.  And from a political point of view, it           avoids the problem of nuclear reduction and nuclear inspections.           Colonel, is this true?  Are you listening?",
"Campbell : I'm listening...",
"Snake    : If word of this got out, it could delay the signing of the Start 3           Treaty and cause a huge international incident.",
"Otacon   : Yeah, it would be nasty.  The United States would be denounced by           the UN... it could even bring the President down...",
"Snake    : Did you know this, Colonel?",
"Campbell : I'm sorry...",
"Snake    : You've changed, Colonel.",
"Campbell : I won't make any excuses...",
"Otacon   : Snake, listen to me.  This new nuclear weapon... it's never           actually been tested, only simulated.",
"Snake    : You mean they ran a computer model?",
"Otacon   : Yeah, that's why they were conducting this excercise.  They needed           to get actual data to back up the simulation.",
"Snake    : What were the results of the excercise?",
"Otacon   : It looks like it went better than they hoped for.  But...I can't           find the data anywhere on this network.  You'd think that data as           important as that would be carefully recorded...",
"Snake    : It was.  President Baker gave me an optical disc with all of the           test data.",
"Campbell : What!? Do you still have it?",
"Snake    : No, Ocelot took it from me.",
"Campbell : Damn...",
"Otacon   : The terrorists have replaced the dummy warhead with a real warhead.           Once they input the detonation codes, they should be ready to           launch.",
"Snake    : So you think they can do it?",
"Otacon   : Well the dummy warhead was designed to be identical to the real           thing, so I think so.",
"Snake    : Did you find out how to override it yet?",
"Otacon   : Not yet.  It must be in a separate file.  Right now, I'm looking           through all of Baker's personal files.",
"Snake    : We're counting on you...",
"Ocelot   : Okay. I've entered the PAL codes and disengaged the safety device.           We can launch anytime.",
"Liquid   : There's still no response from Washington. It looks like we'll have           to show them that we mean business.",
"Ocelot   : Should I set it for Chernoton, Russia?",
"Liquid   : No, there's been a change. The new target is...Lopnor, China.",
"Ocelot   : Why Boss?",
"Liquid   : I'm sure neither you nor Mr. Gurlukovich would really like to see           a nuclear bomb dropped on your Motherland, right?",
"Snake    : Liquid!",
"Ocelot   : But why? There's nothing there.",
"Liquid   : Wrong. It's a nuclear test site.",
"Ocelot   : A nuclear test site?",
"Liquid   : If we nuke a major population center, the game's over... But a           nuclear explosion at a test site can still be concealed from the           public. Meanwhile Washington will be worried about the retaliatory           strike from China.",
"Ocelot   : That'll probably mean top secret talks between both countries'           leaders...",
"Liquid   : Of course. And in the process, the President will be forced to           divulge the existence of a new and highly destabilizing nuclear           weapon to the Chinese. What do you think that will do to the U.S.'s           reputation? Or the President's?",
"Ocelot   : And with the CTBT, that means that China and India... I see...",
"Liquid   : Yes. When the other countries hear about this new weapon, they'll           all want to contact us. Washington won't be very happy when we           start selling their own system to the highest bidders. Yes. The           President will break. He will give in to our demands.",
"Ocelot   : Big Boss's DNA and one billion dollars...",
"Snake    : One billion dollars!",
"Liquid   : That money will be used to cure our genome soldiers as well. I'm           also including the FoxDie vaccine in our demands.",
"Ocelot   : FoxDie... It killed Octopus and the ArmsTech president... So it's           true that it affects older people first. Mantis might not have been           affected because he wore a mask.",
"Liquid   : Wolf wasn't infected either. Perhaps due to those tranquilizers           she always took.",
"Ocelot   : Something to do with the adrenaline level in the blood? Or maybe           it's just because this FoxDie was still experimental and they           haven't worked out all the bugs yet...",
"Liquid   : In any case, have you heard from your friend, Colonel Sergei           Gurlukovich at the Spetznaz?",
"Ocelot   : He still has doubts about the ability of Metal Gear. He said we           can talk after Metal Gear's test launch is successful.",
"Liquid   : He is a very prudent man.",
"Ocelot   : There's nothing to worry about. The Colonel wants Metal Gear and           the new nuclear weapon so bad he can taste it. If Russia wants to           regain its position as a military superpower, they need to           reinforce their nuclear arsenal. They need a nuclear weapon that           can't be intercepted. Metal Gear will allow them to gain first           strike capability over the rest of the world.",
"Liquid   : Their regular army is in shambles and they think they can restore           their country's military power with nuclear weapons? Gurlukovich...           he's no warrior... he is a politician.",
"Ocelot   : But he's the one who gave us the Hind and most of our other heavy           firepower.",
"Liquid   : He's got over a thousand soldiers under his command. If we joined           forces we could put up quite a resistance here. Since Mantis died,           the genome soldiers' brainwashing has started to wear off. I'm           worried about the men's morale. An alliance with the Russians would           boost that as well...",
"Ocelot   : What are you saying?",
"Liquid   : We're not going anywhere. We're going to dig in here.",
"Ocelot   : We could still escape...",
"Liquid   : We've got the most powerful weapon ever made and we're about to           ally with Gurlukovich's forces.",
"Ocelot   : Are you going to fight the whole world?",
"Liquid   : And what's wrong with that? We can launch a nuclear warhead at any           target on this planet... A nuclear warhead invisible to radar. And           on top of that, this base is full of spare nuclear warheads. Once           we get the DNA and the money, the world will be ours!",
"Ocelot   :  What about your promise to Colonel Gurlukovich?",
"Liquid   : I have no interest in the revival of Mother Russia.",
"Ocelot   : ...You're not thinking of reviving Big Boss's dream?",
"Liquid   : From today, ...call this place 'Outer Heaven'.",
"Snake    : Big Boss's dream...",
"Ocelot   : But Boss,... you're not worried about the PAL being overridden? If           the code is entered again, it'll be deactivated.",
"Liquid   : No need to worry. The DARPA Chief and the ArmsTech president are           both dead.",
"Ocelot   : Does Snake know how the override system works?",
"Liquid   : You interrogated him. Don't you know?",
"Ocelot   : He didn't have any keys on him.",
"Liquid   : Good. Then no one can stop Metal Gear now.",
"Ocelot   : By the way, what should we do with that woman? Want me to kill her?",
"Liquid   : Let her live. She's Campbell's niece and Snake cares for her...           We'll keep her as our ace in-the-hole.",
"Snake    : Meryl... she's alive.",
"Otacon   : Snake, I found Baker's top-secret files!",
"Snake    : Great job.",
"Otacon   : How's it going there?",
"Snake    : They've finished inputting the PAL codes. So how do we deactivate           them?",
"Otacon   : Okay...y'see the override system that the president was talking           about... It can also be used to input the detonation codes. Y'see           if you insert the keys when the warhead is active, you deactivate           it. And if you insert them when it's inactive, it becomes           activated. And you can only use the keys once.",
"Snake    : Only once, huh.",
"Otacon   : Yeah...you'd better get started. We don't have much time.",
"Snake    : But it takes three keys, right!? I've only got one of them!",
"Otacon   : Hold on a minute. Y'see that's the trick. You already have all           three keys!",
"Snake    : What are you talking about!?",
"Otacon   : The card key is made of a shape memory alloy.",
"Snake    : Shape memory alloy?",
"Otacon   : Yes. It's a material that changes shape at different temperatures.           The key is made out of it!",
"Snake    : This card key?",
"Otacon   : Yeah. The card key changes shape at different temperatures.",
"Snake    : So this key is actually three keys in one...clever.",
"Otacon   : Can you see the input terminals in the center of the Control           Room...",
"Snake    : I see them.",
"Otacon   : Those three laptop terminals are for the emergency input. There           should be a symbol on each screen... Each symbol corresponds to a           different key. Input the keys in order from left to right. The           left one's for the room temperature key. See the symbol? Next to           that goes the low temperature key. The one on the right is the           high temperature key.",
"Snake    : Okay, I got it. First I change the shape of the card and then I           input them in order, right?",
"Otacon   : That's right. All you do is insert the card keys. After you insert           the key into the module, a hard disk reads the information           contained on it. Once you've finished with all three terminals, the           code input process is complete. But here's the thing. You can only           use the key three times. It's an emergency system and it's only           meant to be used once.",
"Campbell : The world is riding on that key, Snake.",
"Ocelot   : Who's that!!",
"Snake    : Damn!! The key fell in the drainage ditch!",
"Liquid   : Snake!! This is bullet-proof glass! There's no way in! I'll enjoy           watching you die!",
"Campbell : Snake, you've got to get that key!",
"Computer : PAL code number one confirmed. Awaiting PAL code number two...",
"Snake    : Okay, that takes care of PAL code number one... Now PAL number           two... freeze the key.",
"Computer : PAL code number two confirmed. Awaiting PAL code number three...",
"Master   : Snake. It's about Naomi Hunter...",
"Snake    : Then you should talk to the Colonel. He's looking into it.",
"Master   : Turn your monitor off.",
"Snake    : Okay it's off. No one else can hear us. Go ahead.",
"Master   : Sorry, but I didn't want the Colonel to hear.",
"Snake    : Okay, so what's up?",
"Master   : I've got a good friend in the Pentagon...",
"Snake    : Yeah...",
"Master   : He's the one who told me about it... It looks like the DIA recently           developed a new type of assassination weapon.",
"Snake    : An assassination weapon?",
"Master   : Snake, have you ever heard of something called 'Fox Die'?",
"Snake    : No...",
"Master   : Fox Die?",
"Snake    : ...Liquid and others were talking about it...",
"Master   : Yeah. It's some kind of virus that targets specific people. I           don't know all the details, but...",
"Snake    : What are you trying to say?",
"Master   : It's too similar.",
"Snake    : What is!?",
"Master   : The cause of death. Didn't the ArmsTech president and the DARPA           Chief, I mean Decoy Octopus,... die of something that looked like           a heart attack?",
"Snake    : Yeah...?",
"Master   : Well, apparently Fox Die kills its victims by simulating a heart           attack.",
"Snake    : No... You're telling me that Naomi was behind it?",
"Master   : Snake, try to remember. Did Naomi give you some kind of injection?",
"Snake    : ...The nanomachines.",
"Master   : She was in the best position to have done it, but I don't know what           her motive was.",
"Snake    : ...Does the Colonel know?",
"Master   : I'm not sure. But he still hasn't questioned her.",
"Snake    : Okay. I'll ask him myself. Colonel, what's new with the Naomi           situation?",
"Campbell : I just placed Naomi under arrest.",
"Snake    : Arrest?",
"Campbell : She was sending coded messages towards the Alaskan base. I didn't           want to believe it, but she must be working with the terrorists.",
"Snake    : Are you sure?",
"Campbell : I'm afraid so. She's being interrogated now.",
"Snake    : What kind of interrogation?",
"Campbell : Well...I'd like to avoid the rough stuff, but we don't even have           any sodium pentathol here.",
"Snake    : Call me if you find out anything.",
"Master   : So it's true, isn't it?",
"Snake    : Naomi...I can't believe it.",
"Master   : That means the Fox Die vaccine must be around somewhere.",
"Snake    : Listen. I've got bigger things to worry about.",
"Master   : But Snake...you might be infected too, you know.",
"Snake    : All I can do is leave it up to the Colonel.",
"Naomi    : Snake, can you hear me?  It's Naomi...",
"Snake    : Naomi!? ...what the hell!?",
"Naomi    : Campbell and the others are busy right now...I'm on a different           Codec.",
"Snake    : Naomi, is what the Colonel says true?",
"Naomi    : ...Yes.  But not everything I said was a lie. I don't know myself.           I don't know my real name or even what my parents looked like.  I           bought all my identification. But my reason for getting into           genetics was true.",
"Snake    : Cause you want to know yourself, right?",
"Naomi    : That's right. I want to know where I came from...m...my age, my           race... anything.",
"Snake    : Naomi...",
"Naomi    : I was found in Rhodesia sometime in the 80's... a dirty little           orphan...",
"Snake    : Rhodesia? What's now known as Zimbabwe?",
"Naomi    : Yes. Rhodesia was owned by England until 1965 and there were lots           of Indian laborers around.  That's probably where I got my skin           color from, but I'm not even sure about that...",
"Snake    : Naomi, you're too worried about the past. Isn't it enough to           understand who you are now?",
"Naomi    : Understand who I am now!?  Why should I? No one else tries to           understand me.  I was alone for so long... until I met my big           brother and him.",
"Snake    : Your big brother?",
"Naomi    : Yes.... Frank Jaeger.",
"Snake    : What!?",
"Naomi    : He was a young soldier, when he picked me up near the Zambezi           River.  I was half-dead from starvation and he shared his rations           with me.",
"Naomi    : Yes. Frank Jaeger, the man who you destroyed, was my brother and my           only family.",
"Snake    : Gray Fox?",
"Naomi    : We survived that hell together, Frank and I.  He protected me. He's           my one connection... the only connection that I have to my past.",
"Snake    : And he brought you back to America?",
"Naomi    : No.  I was in Mozambique when 'he' came.",
"Snake    : Who is 'he' ? ...You mean Big Boss?",
"Naomi    : He brought us to this land of freedom , this America. But then he           and my brother went back to Africa to continue the war.  And that's           when it happened... You killed my benefactor and sent my brother           home a cripple.  I vowed revenge and joined FOX-HOUND.  I knew it           was my best chance to meet you and I prayed for the day that I           ould...",
"Snake    : So were your prayers answered?",
"Naomi    : Yes. I waited two long years...",
"Snake    : To kill me?  Is that all you cared about?",
"Naomi    : Yes. That's right.  Two years.  You were all I thought about for           two long years...like some kind of twisted obsession...",
"Snake    : Do you still hate me?",
"Naomi    : ...Not exactly.  I was partly wrong about you...",
"Snake    : What about Liquid and the others?",
"Naomi    : No. I'll have my revenge on them too.",
"Snake    : Naomi...you didn't kill that doctor too, did you?  The one that           used Gray Fox for his genome experiments...",
"Naomi    : ...No...that was my brother.  Afterwards I covered it up and helped           him hide out...",
"Snake    : So that Ninja...I mean Gray Fox... he's come here to kill me?",
"Naomi    : ...I don't think so.  I think he just came here to fight you... I           wasn't sure before, but now I think I understand.  A final battle           with you... that's all he lives for. I'm sure of it...",
"Snake    : ...Fox...no... Naomi, tell me something...",
"Naomi    : ...about FoxDie?  FoxDie is a type of retrovirus that targets and           kills only specific people.  First, it infects the macrophages in           the victim's body.  FoxDie contains smart enzymes, created through           protein engineering.  They're programmed to respond to specific           genetic patterns in the cells.",
"Snake    : Those enzymes recognize the target's DNA?",
"Naomi    : Right. They respond by becoming active, and using the macrophages,           they begin creating TNF epsilon.  It's a type of cytokine, a           peptide which causes cells to die.  The TNF epsilon is carried           along the bloodstream to the heart, where they attach to the TNF           receptors in the heart cells.",
"Snake    : And then...they cause a heart attack?",
"Naomi    : The heart cells suffer a shock and undergo an extreme apoptosis.           Then... the victim dies.",
"Snake    : Apoptosis...you mean the heart cells commit suicide... Naomi...",
"Naomi    : ...What?",
"Snake    : ...You must have programmed that thing to kill me too, right? Do I           still have time? Naomi, I don't blame you for wanting me dead.  But           I can't go yet. I still have a job to do.",
"Naomi    : Listen, Snake.  I'm not the one who made the decision to use           FoxDie.",
"Snake    : You weren't?",
"Naomi    : You were injected with FoxDie as a part of this operation. I just           wanted to let you know that... No, that's not the whole truth...           the real thing that I wanted to tell you was... Snake, I... I...",
"Voice    : Hey! What are you doing!?",
"Naomi    : Eeeek!!  Ooooh.... Snake.....",
"Campbell : ...Snake, I can't allow Naomi to make any more unauthorized           transmissions.  Naomi's been removed from this operation.",
"Snake    : What happened to Naomi!? What did she mean when she said that           FoxDie was a part of this operation!?  Colonel, let me talk to her!",
"Campbell : I won't. She's under arrest.",
"Snake    : ...you double crossed me!",
"Campbell : Snake, there's no time for that!",
"Campbell : Right now your job is to stop Metal Gear! ...Okay, Snake!?",
"Computer : PAL code number two conirmed.  Awaiting PAL code number three.",
"Snake    : Okay, there goes PAL code number two. Next comes PAL number           three... warm the key.",
"Computer : PAL code number three confirmed. PAL code entry complete...           Detonation code activated.",
"Snake    : No! Why!",
"Computer : Ready for launch...",
"Master   : Thank you Snake.  Now the detonation code is completed. Nothing can           stop Metal Gear now.",
"Snake    : Master, what's going on?",
"Master   : You found the key and even activated the warhead for us too. I           really must express my gratitude.  Sorry to have involved you in           that silly shape memory alloy business.  We weren't able to learn           the DARPA Chief's code.  Even with Mantis' psychic powers, he           couldn't read his mind.  Then Ocelot accidentally killed him during           the interrogation.  In other words, we weren't able to launch the           nuclear device and we were all getting a little worried.  Without           the threat of a nuclear strike, our demands would never be met.",
"Snake    : What do you mean?",
"Master   : Without the detonation codes, we had to find some other way. That's           when we decided...you might prove useful, Snake.  First I thought           we might get the information from you, Snake.  So I had Decoy           Octopus disguise himself as the DARPA Chief.  Unfortunately Octopus           didn't survive the encounter. ...thanks to FoxDie.",
"Snake    : You mean you had this planned from the beginning? Just to get me to           input the detonation code!?",
"Master   : Huh? You didn't think you made it this far by yourself, did you?",
"Snake    : Who the hell are you!?",
"Master   : In any case, the launch preparations are complete.  Once the world           glimpses the power of this weapon, the White House will have no           choice but to surrender the FoxDie vaccine to me. Their ace-in-the-           hole is useless now...",
"Snake    : Ace-in-the-hole?",
"Master   : The Pentagon's plan to use you was already successful... in the           torture room.",
"Master   : Snake, you're the only one who doesn't know.  Poor fool.",
"Snake    : Who are you anyway!?",
"Master   : I'll tell you everything you want to know.  If you come to where I           am, that is.",
"Snake    : Where are you?",
"Master   : Very close by.",
"Campbell : Snake, that's not Master Miller!",
"Master   : Campbell, you're too late.",
"Campbell : Master Miller's body was just discovered at his home.  He's been           dead for at least three days.  I didn't know because my Codec link           with Master was cut off.  But Mei Ling said his transmission signal           was coming from inside the base!",
"Snake    : So who is it?",
"Campbell : Snake, you've been talking to...",
"Liquid   : ...Me... dear brother.",
"Snake    : Liquid!? How the...!?",
"Liquid   : You've served your purpose.  You may die now!",
"Snake    : Liquid!!",
"Liquid   : Snake, did you like my sunglasses? You'd point a weapon at your own           brother?",
"Snake    : Why did you disguise yourself as Master?",
"Liquid   : So I could manipulate you more easily. And you performed quite well           I must say. Although the boys at the Pentagon are probably saying           the same thing...",
"Snake    : What the hell are you talking about!?",
"Liquid   : Following orders blindly with no questions asked. You've lost your           warrior's pride and become nothing more than a pawn, Snake.",
"Snake    : What?",
"Liquid   : Stopping the nuclear launch, rescuing the hostages... It was all           just a diversion.",
"Snake    : A diversion?",
"Liquid   : The Pentagon only needed for you to come into contact with us.           That's what killed the ArmsTech president and Decoy Octopus.",
"Snake    : You don't mean...",
"Liquid   : That's right. You were sent in here to kill us so they could           retrieve Metal Gear undamaged along with the bodies of the genome           soldiers. From the beginning, the Pentagon was just using you as a           vector to spread FoxDie!",
"Snake    : Fox Die! ...It can't be! Are you telling me Naomi was working with           the Pentagon?",
"Liquid   : They thought she was. But it seems that Dr. Naomi Hunter couldn't           be controlled so easily.",
"Snake    : What?",
"Liquid   : We've got a spy working in the Pentagon. He reported that Dr.           Hunter altered FoxDie's program just before the operation. But...no           one knows how or why.",
"Snake    : I wonder... maybe they arrested her so they could find out the           answer to that.",
"Liquid   : No doubt. But I had no idea she was motivated by such petty           revenge... we still don't know what changes she made to FoxDie's           program. Oh well. It doesn't matter. I've already added the FoxDie           vaccine to my list of White House demands.",
"Snake    : There's a vaccine?",
"Liquid   : There must be. But that woman is the only one who really knows.           Anyway, it might prove to be unnecessary.",
"Snake    : Why is that?",
"Liquid   : You were successful in coming into contact with all of us, so we           must have all been exposed to the virus. It's true that the           ArmsTech president and Decoy Octopus were killed by FoxDie... But           Ocelot, myself, and you, the carrier, were apparently unaffected.",
"Snake    : A bug in the virus' programming?",
"Liquid   : Hmm, could be. In any case, if it doesn't kill you then I'm not           worried either. After all, our genetic code is identical.",
"Snake    : So it's true...you and I are...",
"Liquid   : Yes, twins, but we're not ordinary twins... we're twins linked by           cursed genes. Les enfants terribles. You're fine. You got all the           old man's dominant genes. I got all the flawed, recessive genes.           Everything was done so that you would be the greatest of his           children. The only reason I exist is so they could create you.",
"Snake    : I was the favorite, huh.",
"Liquid   : That's right! I'm just the leftovers of what they used to make you.           Can you understand what it's like to know that you're garbage since           the day you were born!? But...I'm the one father chose.",
"Snake    : ...So that's why you're so obsessed with Big Boss. Some warped           kind of love.",
"Liquid   : Love!? It's hate!! He always told me I was inferior and now I'll           have my revenge!! You should understand me, brother. You killed           our father with your own hands! You stole my chance for revenge!           Now I'll finish the work that father began. I will surpass him...           I will destroy him!",
"Snake    : You're just like Naomi.",
"Liquid   : Well I'm not like you. Unlike you, I'm proud of the destiny that           is encoded into my very genes. Yeah!",
"Snake    : Damn!!",
"Liquid   : Snake! Your blood will be the first to be spilt by this glorious           new weapon. Consider it an honor... a gift from your brother. Now,           I'll show you! The power of the weapon that will lead us in the           21st century!",
"Snake    :  It's moving...",
"Snake    : How do I stop it?",
"Snake    : Did that do it!? Damn!!!",
"Liquid   :  Nice try, Snake! Die!!",
"Fox      : Hurry! Get away!",
"Snake    : Gray Fox!!",
"Fox      : A name from long ago. It sounds better than Deepthroat.",
"Snake    : So it is you!?",
"Fox      : You look terrible, Snake. You haven't aged well.",
"Liquid   : I'll send you back to hell!",
"Snake    : Fox, why!? What do you want from me!?",
"Fox      : I'm a prisoner of Death. Only you can free me...",
"Snake    : Fox, stay out of this... What about Naomi? She's hell bent on           taking revenge for you.",
"Fox      : Naomi...",
"Snake    : You're the only one who can stop her.",
"Fox      : No...I can't.",
"Snake    : Why?",
"Fox      : Because I'm the one who killed her parents. I was young then and           couldn't bring myself to kill her too. I felt so bad that I decided           to take her with me. I raised her like she was my own blood to           soothe my guilty conscience. Even now she thinks of me as her           brother...",
"Snake    : Fox...",
"Fox      : From the outside, we might have seemed like a happy brother and           sister. But every time I looked at her, I saw her parents' eyes           staring back at me... Tell her for me. Tell her that I was the one           who did it.",
"Liquid   : There you are!",
"Fox      : We're just about out of time. Here's a final present from           Deepthroat. I'll stop it from moving!",
"Snake    : Fox!",
"Liquid   : In the Middle East, we don't hunt foxes, we hunt jackals. Instead           of foxhounds, we use royal harriers.",
"Snake    : Fox!",
"Liquid   : How strong is that exoskeleton of yours?",
"Liquid   : Snake, are you just going to sit by and watch him die?",
"Fox      : A cornered fox is more dangerous than a jackal!",
"Snake    : He destroyed the radome...",
"Liquid   : Impressive. You are indeed worthy of the codename 'Fox'! But now           you're finished!",
"Fox      : Uuunnggh!! .....Now! Fire the Stinger!",
"Snake    : Fox!",
"Liquid   : Can you really shoot? You'll kill him too!",
"Fox      : Now in front of you. I can finally die. After Zanzibar, I was taken           from the battle neither truly alive nor truly dead... an undying           shadow in the world of lights. But soon... soon. It will finally...           end.",
"Liquid   : Die!",
"Fox      : Snake, we're not tools of the government or anyone else! Fighting           was the only thing... the only thing I was good at, but... At least           I always fought for what I believed in... Snake... farewell.",
"Snake    : Fooooooox!!!",
"Liquid   : Foolish man. He prayed for death... and it found him. You see? You           can't protect anyone!! Not even yourself! Die!!",
"Liquid   : Snake, I'll crush you into dust!",
"Snake    : Ooooh! Uuuuff!",
"Liquid   : Sleeping late as usual, ...eh Snake?",
"Snake    : Liquid... you're still alive...",
"Liquid   : I won't die. ...as long as you still live.",
"Snake    : Too bad. It looks like your revolution was a failure.",
"Liquid   : Just because you've destroyed Metal Gear doesn't mean I'm done           fighting.",
"Snake    : Fighting? What are you really after?",
"Liquid   : A world here warriors like us are honored as we once were... as           we should be.",
"Snake    : That was Big Boss's fantasy.",
"Liquid   : It was his dying wish! When he was young, during the Cold War, the           world needed men like us. We were valued then. We were desired.           But things... are different now. With all the liars and hypocrites           running the world, war isn't what it used to be... We're losing our           place in a world that no longer needs us. A world that now spurns           our very existence. You should know that as well as I do. After I           launch this weapon and get our billion dollars, we'll be able to           bring chaos and honor... back to this world gone soft. Conflict           will breed conflict, new hatreds will arise. Then! ...we'll           steadily expand our sphere of influence.",
"Snake    : But as long as there are people, there will always be war.",
"Liquid   : But the problem... is balance. Father knew what type of a           balance was best...",
"Snake    : Is that the only reason?",
"Liquid   : Isn't it reason enough? For warriors such as us.",
"Snake    : I don't want that kind of world!",
"Liquid   : Ha! You lie! So why are you here then? Why do you continue to           follow your orders while your superiors betray you? Why did you           come here?",
"Snake    : ......",
"Liquid   : Well... I'll tell you then. You enjoy all the killing, that's why.",
"Snake    : What!",
"Liquid   : Are you dnying it? Haven't you already killed most of my comrades?",
"Snake    : That was...",
"Liquid   : I watched your face when you did it. It was filled with the joy of           battle.",
"Snake    : You're wrong!",
"Liquid   : There's a killer inside you... You don't have to deny it. We were           created to be that way.",
"Snake    : Created?",
"Liquid   : Les enfants terribles... the terrible children. That's what the           project was called. It started in the 1970's. Their plan was to           artificially create the most powerful soldier possible. The person           that they chose as the model was the man known then as the greatest           living soldier in the world...",
"Snake    : Big Boss...",
"Liquid   : But father was wounded in combat and already in a coma when they           brought him in. So they created us from his cells... with a           combination of 20th century analog cloning and the Super Baby           Method.",
"Snake    : Super Baby Method?",
"Liquid   : They fertilized an egg with one of father's cells, and then let it           divide into eight clone babies. Then they transferred the clones           to someone's uterus and later intentionally aborted six of the           fetuses to encourage strong fetal growth... You and I were           originally octuplets.",
"Snake    : Octuplets...",
"Liquid   : Yes. The other six of our brothers were sacrificed to make us. We           were accomplices in murder before the day we were even born. So it           was you and I. Two fertilized eggs with exactly the same DNA.           But... they weren't finished yet. They used me as a guinea pig! To           create a phenotype in which all of the dominant genes were           expressed.... to create you. I got all of the recessive genes!",
"Snake    : .......",
"Liquid   : You took everything from me before I was even born! But... you and           I aren't his only children.",
"Snake    : What?",
"Liquid   : The Genome Soldiers. They too are his progeny, carrying on his           genetic legacy.  But they're different. They're digital. With the           completion of the Human Genome project the mysteries of humanity           were laid bare...",
"Liquid   : Thanks to father’s DNA, they were able to identify more than sixty           ‘soldier genes’ responsible for everything from strategic           thinking... to the proverbial ‘killer instinct’. Those ‘soldier           genes’ were transplanted, into the membrane of Next Generation           Special Forces. That’s how they became the Genome Soldiers. That’s           right... The Genome Soldiers that you’ve been killing are our           brothers, with the same genes as ours.",
"Snake    : The Genome Soldiers!?",
"Liquid   : That's right. They are our brothers, created artificially through           the alignment of nucleotides  to mimic our father's genes. They           too are the product of numerous sacrifices.",
"Snake    : Sacrifices?",
"Liquid   : Human experiments.",
"Liquid   : 1991, the Gulf War. The military secretly injected soldiers with           the soldier genes. The Gulf War Syndrome that hundreds of thousands           of returning soldiers complained about, was a side effect of it.",
"Snake    : Hah. Everyone knows that the Gulf War Syndrome was caused by           exposure to depleted uranium used in anti-tank rounds.",
"Liquid   : That was just a cover story issued by the Pentagon. First they           tried to say it was post-dramatic stress disorder, then chemical           or biological weapons. The poison gas detection units and the           anti-sarin injections. They were all just a cover up of this secret           genetic experiment.",
"Snake    : So then... the so called Gulf War Babies that have been reported           by Gulf War veterans are...",
"Liquid   : Yes... They too our are brothers and sisters.",
"Snake    : So the Genome Soldiers mean that the experiments were a success?",
"Liquid   : Success? Don’t be a fool! They’re a complete failure! We’re on the           verge of extinction.",
"Snake    : What!?",
"Liquid   : Have you ever heard of the Asymmetry Theory? Nature tends to favor           asymmetry. Those species which have gone extinct all show signs of           symmetry. The Genome Soldiers suffer from the same problem... signs           of symmetry. So do I, as do you.",
"Snake    :  !!!",
"Liquid   : That's right. We are all on the verge of death at the genetic            level. We don't know when or what type of disease will occur.           That’s why we need the old man's genetic information.",
"Snake    : You want Big Boss's DNA so you can save your family? It's very            touching.",
"Liquid   : In Nature, family members don't  mate with each other. And yet           they help each other to survive. Do you know why? It increases the           chance that their genes will be passed on to a new generation.           Altruism among blood relatives is a response to natural selection.           It's called the Selfish Gene Theory.",
"Snake    : You're telling me that your genes are ordering you to save the           Genome Soldiers?",
"Liquid   : You can't fight your genes. It's fate. All living things are born           for the sole purpose of passing on their parents' genes. That's           why I'll follow what my genes tell me. And then I'm going to go           beyond. In order to break the curse of my heritage. And to do           that... first I will kill you.  Look behind you!",
"Snake    : Meryl!? Is she alive?",
"Liquid   : I'm not sure. She was alive a few hours ago. Poor girl kept calling           your name.",
"Snake    : Meryl...",
"Liquid   : Stupid woman. Falling in love with a man who doesn't even have a           name...",
"Snake    : I have a name!",
"Liquid   : No! We have no past, no future. And even if we did, it wouldn't be           truly ours. You and I are just copies of our father, Big Boss.",
"Snake    : Let Meryl go!",
"Liquid   : As soon as we finished our business. We're almost out of time.",
"Snake    : ...You're talking about FoxDie?",
"Liquid   : No. It seems now that the Pentagon knows that Metal Gear is           destroyed, they've arrived at a decision. They won't even need a           BDA (battle damage assessment). If you want the details why don't           you ask your precious Colonel Campbell?",
"Snake    : Colonel! Can you hear me?",
"Campbell : Yes... I'm listening.",
"Snake    : What is the Pentagon trying to do!? Colonel! Colonel! Answer me!",
"Campbell : The Secretary of Defense has taken over active control of this           operation. He's on his way there by AWACS.",
"Snake    : What for?",
"Campbell : To bomb the place.",
"Snake    : What!?",
"Campbell : Not only that. B-2 Bombers just lifted off from Galena Airforce           Base. They're carrying B61-13 surface- piercing tactical nuclear           bombs.",
"Snake    : What?! Metal Gear is destroyed. Tell the Secretary of Defense!",
"Campbell : The Secretary of Defense heard that Naomi double-crossed us and           he's worried about Fox Die. Now that there's no more danger of a           nuclear strike from Metal Gear, he's going to do whatever's           necessary to cover up the truth of what really happened here.",
"Snake    : He's going to drop a nuclear bomb to vaporize all the evidence           along with anyone who knows anything...",
"Campbell : Don't worry, Snake. I'll stop the nuclear strike.",
"Snake    : How?",
"Campbell : I may only be a figurehead here, but I'm still officially in            command of this mission. If I issue an order to delay the strike.           It'll confuse the chain of command and at least buy you some time.           It'll give you a chance to escape!",
"Snake    : But Colonel, if you do that...",
"Campbell : It's okay, Snake. ...The truth is FOX-HOUND was already the subject           of an undercover investigation. Meryl was transferred to this base           just before the terrorist attack... as a way of manipulating me.",
"Snake    : Those bastards...",
"Campbell : I'm sorry. They forced me to cooperate in exchange for her life.           You'd better get out of there, Snake.",
"Snake    : Are you sure? ...It'll be bad for you.",
"Campbell : Don't worry. It's the least I can do for you after all the lies.",
"Snake    : Colonel...",
"Campbell : I'm ordering them to cancel the bombing run. After that there's no           turning back... Aaaah! What are you doing!?",
"Mei Ling : Snake!",
"Snake    : Mei Ling, what happened to the Colonel!?",
"Mei Ling : ...I don't believe it!!",
"Snake    : What happened!?",
"Mei Ling : Snake, the Colonel...!!",
"Houseman : Roy Campbell has been relieved of duty. This is the Secretary of           Defense, Jim Houseman.",
"Snake    : Put the Colonel back on!",
"Houseman : He's been placed under arrest for leaking top-secret information           and for the crime of high treason.",
"Snake    : Ridiculous!",
"Houseman : Yes, he's a ridiculous man. He truly believed that he was in           command of this operation.",
"Snake    : You bastard...!",
"Houseman : There won't be a speck of evidence left. I'm sure the President           would want the same thing.",
"Snake    : The President ordered this?",
"Houseman : The President is a busy man. I have complete authority here.",
"Snake    : How do you plan on explaining a nuclear attack on Alaska to the           media?",
"Houseman : Don't worry. We've prepared a convincing cover story. We'll simply           say that the terrorists exploded a nuclear device.",
"Snake    : ...Smart. You'll be murdering everyone here. The scientists, the           Genome Army, everyone...",
"Houseman : Donald... the DARPA Chief is already dead...",
"Snake    : So you didn't mean to kill the DARPA Chief after all?",
"Houseman : He was my friend.",
"Snake    : And you could care less about what happens to everybody else, huh?",
"Houseman : Well, if you give me the optic disc, I might consider saving them.",
"Snake    : What are you talking about?",
"Houseman : Metal Gear's test data! Donald was supposed to bring it back.",
"Snake    : I don't have it.",
"Houseman : I see. Oh well that's okay... You two are an embarrassment from the           1970's. ...our country's dirty little secret. You can’t be allowed           to live. Well, the bombs will be dropping soon, and you two have a           lot of catching up to do. Farewell.",
"Liquid    : There's no way out for us. Let's finish this before the air           strike. You stole everything from me. Only your death can satisfy           me. Only your death can return to me what is rightly mine. She'll           make a beautiful sacrifice for our final battle.",
"Do you see this? It will be the time limit for our final battle.           This nuclear module is set to detonate at the precise moment of           her death.",
"If you win... you might still be able to save her. You could enjoy           one brief moment of love… before the end. If you cross this line,           you’ll fall... At this it will kill even you.",
"Liquid   : Snaaaaaaaaake!!!",
"Snake    : Meryl?  ....Meryl?   Meeeeryyyyylll!",
"Snake    : Forgive me.  Damn!  I gave into my fear.  I gave into my pain.  I           sold your life to save my oen...  I'm a loser.  I'm not the hero           you thought I was.  I'm nothing!  Meryl, I'm sorry!  Forgive me.",
"Otacon   : Meryl can't forgive anyone anymore.",
"Snake    : Otacon?",
"Otacon   : She's gone, Snake.",
"Snake    : ...Because of me....",
"Otacon   : I guess blaming yourself makes it easier, huh?  If you do that, you           can keep the pain at a nice, safe distance.",
"Snake    : What the hell do you know?  Meryl's dead.  I lost.",
"Otacon   : So, are you going to stay here and die?  Along with her?  Snake,           people die.... But death is not defeat.  That's what Hemmingway           said.  I lost Wolf too.  But that wasn't defeat.  She and I will           be together forever.  We didn't lose anything.",
"Snake    : Together forever?",
"Otacon   : It's true that Wolf is dead.... but our love didn't die with her.           Life's more than just a game of win or lose.  Don't you think?           Let's live, Snake.  There's a parking garage right next door.  We           can get to the surface from there.  C'mon.  I released all the           security locks.  It'll be okay.  We can excape.... You have my word           on it.",
"Snake    : Otacon... you've changed.",
"Otacon   : I'm through regreting the past...  Life isn't all about loss y'know.",
"Otacon   : It's started!  Those guys.... seems like they only hurry when           they're destroying things.  Good.  let 'em destroy it.  But they           can't destroy the human spirit.",
"Snake    : Okay.  Let's go!  Meryl, I hope you're still watching me.  Maybe I           can prove myself to you after all.",
"Snake    : C'mon, hustle!",
"Otacon   : Snake, it's cold outside.  You'll freeze like that.",
"Snake    : My sneaking suit!",
"Otacon   : You better hurry...  Hurry!",
"Otacon   : Now you look like yourself again.",
"Snake    : Otacon, are you okay?",
"Otacon   : I guess so....",
"Snake    : Otacon, can you move?",
"Otacon   : It's no use.",
"Snake    : What happened to Liquid?",
"Otacon   : I don't know, but I hope he's dead.",
"Snake    : Liquid is dead... Uh oh!",
"Liquid   : Snake!",
"Liquid   : ...Snaaaake... Fo... Fox...?",
"Snake    : If he's dead, that means....",
"Otacon   : Don't think about it, Snake.",
"Snake    : What happened to the air raid? No stealth bombers in sight.",
"Campbell : Snake, can you hear me?",
"Snake    : Colonel!",
"Campbell : Are you okay?",
"Snake    : Colonel, what happened?",
"Campbell : The Secretary of Defense has been arrested. Early retirement.",
"Snake    : Arrested?",
"Campbell : I was able to get into contact with the President. Metal Gear, the           training exercise...all of it...it was all the Secretary of Defense           acting alone.",
"Snake    : Acting alone? What happened to the air raid and the nuclear strike?",
"Campbell : The orders were rescinded. The F117s and the B2 Spirits have           returned to the base. Once again, I have complete authority over           this operation.",
"Snake    : I see...",
"Campbell : Washington isn't stupid enough to use nukes to cover up a few           secrets.",
"Snake    : I wonder about that.",
"Campbell : In any case, the danger's over... Thanks, Snake.",
"Snake    : Colonel, about Meryl...",
"Campbell : I already know.",
"Snake    : ..... Colonel",
"Campbell : Meryl was my daughter....",
"Snake    : What!?",
"Campbell : I didn't find out until recently.  I got a letter from her           mother... my dead brother's wife... I was going to tell her after           this operation was over.",
"Snake    : Colonel, I....",
"Campbell : It's okay, Snake.  Thanks anyway. Snake, I'm sorry I... I kept a           lot of things from you.",
"Snake    : It's okay, Colonel.",
"Campbell : Snake, I'm not a Colonel.",
"Snake    : Oh that's right.",
"Campbell : I've got a present for you. There's a snowmobile close to you. Mei           Ling saw it on the satellite photos. This time of the year the           glaciers are pretty calm. You should be able to ride right out of           there. I'll bet the boys at the DIA and the NSA never expected you           to come home alive.",
"Snake    : Me neither. I better not show my face around here.",
"Campbell : No danger of that. You two officially died after your jeep sank           into the ocean...",
"Snake    : That's not too far from the truth.",
"Campbell : Also there's a helicopter waiting for you on Fox Island.",
"Snake    : Okay, Roy. Are you going to be okay?",
"Campbell : Don't worry. I've got an insurance policy... a hard copy of all           Mei Ling's data. As long as I've got that, you, me and Mei Ling           will be fine.",
"Snake    : The battery on these nanomachines will run out soon. They won't be           able to follow us.",
"Campbell : I guess we won't meet again.",
"Snake    : Don't worry. I'll pay you a visit sometime.",
"Campbell : Really? I'll look forward to that.",
"Snake    : Roy, just tell me one thing.",
"Campbell : What?",
"Snake    : About Fox Die.",
"Campbell : Meryl will be fine. She wasn't included in its programming.",
"Snake    : What about me? It killed Liquid...",
"Campbell : Naomi said that she wants to talk to you face to face about that.",
"Snake    : How is she?",
"Campbell : Don't worry. Mei Ling's with her right now. I'm switching over to           Naomi.",
"Naomi    : Snake, it's me...",
"Snake    : Naomi...",
"Naomi    : I heard...about my brother...",
"Snake    : I'm sorry... but he had one last message he wanted to say to you.           He told me to tell you to forget about him and to go on with your           own life.",
"Naomi    : Frankie said that?",
"Snake    : Yeah. He also said he'll always love you... Naomi, your brother           just saved you, me and the whole world. He fought with every ounce           of strength in his body.",
"Naomi    : Maybe... maybe now he's finally found some peace. He wasn't really           my brother anymore... Ever since he fought with you in Zanzibar           he's been like a ghost. A ghost looking for a place to die...",
"Snake    : Naomi, Liquid died from Fox Die too. What about me? When am I           gonna go?",
"Naomi    : That's up to you.",
"Snake    : What do you mean?",
"Naomi    : Everybody dies when their time's up...",
"Snake    : Yeah, so when's mine up?",
"Naomi    : It's up to you how you use the time left to you. Live, Snake.           That's all I can say to you.",
"Snake    : ..........",
"Naomi    : Each person is born with their fate written into their own genetic           code... it's unchangeable, immutable... But that's not all there           is to life. I finally realized that. I told you before. The reason           that I was interested in genes and DNA. Because I wanted to know           who I was... where I came from. I thought that if I analyzed my           DNA I could find out who I was, who my parents were. And I thought           that if I knew that, then I'd know what path I should take in life.",
"But I was wrong. I didn't find anything. I didn't learn anything.           Just like with the Genome Soldiers... you can input all the genetic           information, but that doesn't make them into the strongest           soldiers. The most we can say about DNA is that it governs a           person's potential strengths... potential destiny. You mustn't           allow yourself to be chained to fate... to be ruled by your genes.           Humans can choose the type of life they want to live.",
"Snake, whether or not you're in the FoxDie program isn't important.           The important thing is that you choose life... And then live! Don't           you think, Snake?",
"Don't worry.  I'm going to choose life too. Until today, I've           always looked for a reason to live. But from here on, I'm going to           just live.",
"Genes exist to pass down our hopes and dreams for the future           through our children. Living is a link to the future. That's how           all life works. Loving each other, teaching each other... that's           how we can change the world. I finally realized it. The true           meaning of life... Thank you, Snake.",
"Snake    : Until today, I've lived only for myself.  Survival has been the           only thing I cared about in my life.",
"Otacon   : That's not just you.  That's how everyone is.",
"Snake    : I only felt truly alive when I was staring Death in the face.  I           don't know, maybe it's written into my genes.",
"Otacon   : What about now?",
"Snake    : I want to enjoy life.  I really do.  How about you, Otacon?",
"Otacon   : Me?  I feel like a new man.",
"Snake    : So what are you going to do?  Continue your research?",
"Otacon   : No, I'm finished with science...  I'm interested in human           psychology            now.",
"Snake    : Sounds good...",
"Otacon   : The whole reason I got into science in the first place was because           I was no good with people.  I was scared of them.  I was scared of           life.  I thought that I could never understand them because they're           so illogical.  But I've finally learned how to like people.  I'm           not afraid anymore.",
"Snake    : You and I are more alike than I thought...",
"Otacon   : I'm just tired of always being a spectator in life.  I'm ready to           live.  I'm gonna stand on my own two feet.  I'm not gonna hide           anymore.",
"Snake    : You're giving up your stealth camo?",
"Otacon   : Huh? Oh yeah... You can have it.",
"Otacon   : ...So, this is where we say goodbye to our loves as well... Want me           to drive?",
"Snake    : No thanks.  I'd rather do it myself.",
"Otacon   : No problem. Where to, Snake?",
"Snake    : My real name is David, Otacon.",
"Otacon   : I'm Hal, Dave.",
"Snake    : Oh, that's right... Hal.  Hal and Dave?  That's a good one.  Ha ha           ha ha ha... Maybe we should take a trip to Jupiter...",
"Otacon   : So where are you going, Dave?",
"Snake    : Hmmm. I think it's time for me to look for a new path in life.",
"Otacon   : A new path?",
"Snake    : A new purpose.",
"Otacon   : Will you find it?",
"Snake    : I'll find it.  I know I'll find it.",
"Naomi    : You mustn’t allowed yourself to be chained to fate... to be ruled           by our genes. Humans can choose the type of life they want to live.           The important thing is that you choose life... And then... live!",
"Ocelot   : Yes sir.  The entire unit was wiped out.  Those two are still           alive.  The vector?  Yes sir.  FoxDie should become activated           soon... Right on schedule.",
"Yes sir.  I recovered all of Rex's dummy warhead data.  ...No sir.           My cover is intact.  Nobody knows who I really am.  Yes the DARPA           Chief knew my identity but he's been disposed of.",
"Yes.  Thank you.  Good-bye.  Mr. President.",
"Liquid   : Snaaaaaaaaake!!!",
"Snake    : Meryl? Meryl!?",
"Meryl    : Uh, Uh, uhnnn... Snake? Is that you? Snake! You're alive! Thank           God!",
"Snake    : Meryl? Meryl, are you okay?",
"Meryl    : Are you okay... Is that all you can say?",
"Snake    : Meryl, it must have been terrible...",
"Meryl    : It wasn't that bad. I didn't give in to the torture.",
"Snake    : Torture?",
"Meryl    : ...And things even worse than that... I was fighting too. Just like           you.",
"Snake    : You're a strong woman.",
"Meryl    : Fighting them... made me feel closer to you. I felt like you were           there with me. It gave me the strength to go on. But I was scared.",
"Snake    : ...I'm sorry.",
"Meryl    : Don't say that... But it made me realize something. During all the           pain and shame there was one thing I was sure of... a single hope           that I held onto... And that hope kept me alive...",
"Snake, I wanted to see you again...",
"Otacon   : Snake, it's me.",
"Snake    : Otacon, good news! Meryl's okay.",
"Otacon   : All right!!! You saved her, man. Good job!",
"Snake    : I got some bad news too. We're about to be bombed.",
"Otacon   : Oh boy. I guess we're considered expendable.",
"Snake    : Is there a way out of here?",
"Otacon   : A way out? ...Uh, yeah. You can take the loading tunnel to the           surface. There's a parking garage right next to you. The tunnel           leads from there to the surface.",
"Snake    : The door in front?",
"Otacon   : No. It's a small entrance to the west of that door.",
"Snake    : How about the security?",
"Otacon   : I just unlocked it. Who do you think you're talking to? I'll take           care of security along your escape route too...",
"Snake    : What are you going to do?",
"Otacon   : Me? I... I'll stay here.",
"Snake    : Are you crazy!",
"Otacon   : I need a little more time to take care of your escape route.",
"Snake    : But...",
"Otacon   : Unlocking the security doors is difficult work. Only I can do it.",
"Snake    : Otacon?",
"Otacon   : Don't worry. I'm staying here. It's my own decision.",
"Snake    : Otacon, this is a hardened shelter, but they're going to use a           surface piercing nuclear bomb. It won't hold.",
"Otacon   : I'm through regretting the past... Life isn't all about loss,           y'know...",
"Snake    : ........",
"Otacon   : Snake, I'm a complete person now. I've found a reason to live.",
"Snake    : Good. Don't die on me.",
"Otacon   : Same to you.  Take care of Meryl, okay.",
"Snake    : I will...",
"Otacon   : Okay I gotta go. I promise I'll do something about your escape           route.",
"Snake    : Thanks.",
"Otacon   : 'Thanks'... oh, that sounds nice.",
"Snake    : ...I believe in you.",
"Otacon   : Thanks, Snake.",
"Snake    : Let's get the hell out of here.",
"Meryl    : ...What about him...? Where is Otacon!?",
"Snake    : He's... He's... fighting right now... With his old self... to be           the man he wants to be.",
"Meryl    : He's fighting for us too?",
"Snake    : Yeah, and I don't want it to be in vain.",
"Meryl    : ...Me too.",
"Snake    : Meryl.",
"Meryl    : ...Snake.",
"Snake    : Meryl. It's started...",
"Meryl    : I must be heavy...",
"Snake    : It looks like we're not gonna have a love scene after all.",
"Meryl    : Looks that way. Too bad...",
"Snake    : Let's get out of here!",
"Meryl    : Snake, it's freezing outside. You need some clothes.",
"Snake    : There's my Sneaking Suit!",
"Meryl    : Hurry up. Hurry! Hmm... Looking good, Snake.",
"Snake    : Meryl, are you okay?",
"Meryl    : ...Yeah, just a little shook up.",
"Snake    : Meryl, can you move?",
"Meryl    : It's no good. I can't move.",
"Snake    : What happened to Liquid?",
"Meryl    : I can't see him either...",
"Snake    : Liquid is dead... Uh oh!",
"Liquid   : Snake!",
"Liquid   : ...Snaaaake... Fo... Fox...?",
"Snake    : Die... If he's dead, that means...",
"Meryl    : Don't say it, Snake.",
"Snake    : What happened to the air raid? No Stealth bombers in sight.",
"Campbell : Snake, can you hear me?",
"Snake    : Colonel!",
"Campbell : Are you okay?",
"Snake    : Colonel, what happened?",
"Campbell : The Secretary of Defense has been arrested. Early retirement.",
"Snake    : Arrested?",
"Campbell : I was able to get into contact with the President. Metal Gear, the           training exercise...all of it...it was all the Secretary of Defense           acting alone.",
"Snake    : Acting alone? What happened to the air raid and the nuclear strike?",
"Campbell : The orders were rescinded. The F117s and the B2 Spirits have           returned to the base. Once again, I have complete authority over           this operation.",
"Snake    : I see...",
"Campbell : Washington isn't stupid enough to use nukes to cover up a few           secrets.",
"Snake    : I wonder about that.",
"Campbell : In any case, the danger's over... Thanks, Snake.",
"Snake    : Colonel, you can rest easy. Meryl's fine.",
"Campbell : Really? Thanks... Thank you, Snake.  Snake, I'm sorry I... I kept           a lot of things from you.",
"Snake    : It's okay, Colonel.",
"Campbell : Snake, I'm not a Colonel.",
"Snake    : Oh that's right.",
"Campbell : I've got a present for you. There's a snowmobile close to you. Mei           Ling saw it on the satellite photos. This time of the year the           glaciers are pretty calm. You should be able to ride right out of           there. I'll bet the boys at the DIA and the NSA never expected you           to come home alive.",
"Snake    : Me neither. I better not show my face around here.",
"Campbell : No danger of that. You two officially died after your jeep sank           into the ocean...",
"Snake    : That's not too far from the truth.",
"Campbell : Also there's a helicopter waiting for you on Fox Island.",
"Snake    : Dr. Hal Emmerich should be somewhere on the base. I want someone           to bring him in.",
"Campbell : I understand. Leave it to me.",
"Snake    : Okay, Roy. Are you going to be okay?",
"Campbell : Don't worry. I've got an insurance policy... a hard copy of all           Mei Ling's data. As long as I've got that, you, me and Mei Ling           will be fine.",
"Snake    : The battery on these nanomachines will run out soon. They won't be           able to follow us.",
"Campbell : I guess we won't meet again.",
"Snake    : Don't worry. I'll pay you a visit sometime.",
"Campbell : Really? I'll look forward to that.",
"Snake    : Roy, just tell me one thing.",
"Campbell : What?",
"Snake    : About Fox Die.",
"Campbell : Meryl will be fine. She wasn't included in its programming.",
"Snake    : What about me? It killed Liquid...",
"Campbell : Naomi said that she wants to talk to you face to face about that.",
"Snake    : How is she?",
"Campbell : Don't worry. Mei Ling's with her right now. I'm switching over to            Naomi.",
"Naomi    : Snake, it's me...",
"Snake    : Naomi...",
"Naomi    : I heard...about my brother...",
"Snake    : I'm sorry... but he had one last message he wanted to say to you.           He told me to tell you to forget about him and to go on with your           own life.",
"Naomi    : Frankie said that?",
"Snake    : Yeah. He also said he'll always love you... Naomi, your brother           just saved you, me and the whole world. He fought with every ounce           of strength in his body.",
"Naomi    : Maybe... maybe now he's finally found some peace. He wasn't really           my brother anymore... Ever since he fought with you in Zanzibar           he's been like a ghost. A ghost looking for a place to die...",
"Snake    : Naomi, Liquid died from Fox Die too. What about me? When am I           gonna go?",
"Naomi    : That's up to you.",
"Snake    : What do you mean?",
"Naomi    : Everybody dies when their time's up...",
"Snake    : Yeah, so when's mine up?",
"Naomi    : It's up to you how you use the time left to you. Live, Snake.            That's all I can say to you.",
"Snake    : ..........",
"Naomi    : Each person is born with their fate written into their own genetic           code... it's unchangeable, immutable... But that's not all there           is to life. I finally realized that. I told you before. The reason           that I was interested in genes and DNA. Because I wanted to know           who I was... where I came from. I thought that if I analyzed my           DNA I could find out who I was, who my parents were. And I thought           that if I knew that, then I'd know what path I should take in life.",
"But I was wrong. I didn't find anything. I didn't learn anything.           Just like with the Genome Soldiers... you can input all the genetic           information, but that doesn't make them into the strongest           soldiers. The most we can say about DNA is that it governs a           person's potential strengths... potential destiny. You mustn't           allow yourself to be chained to fate... to be ruled by your genes.           Humans can choose the type of life they want to live.",
"Snake, whether or not you're in the FoxDie program isn't important.           The important thing is that you choose life... And then live! Don't           you think, Snake?",
"Don't worry.  I'm going to choose life too. Until today, I've           always looked for a reason to live. But from here on, I'm going to           just live.",
"Genes exist to pass down our hopes and dreams for the future           through our children. Living is a link to the future. That's how           all life works. Loving each other, teaching each other... that's           how we can change the world. I finally realized it. The true           meaning of life... Thank you, Snake.",
"Meryl    : Look. I found this.",
"Snake    : Let's keep it. As a reminder.",
"Meryl    : Of what? A reminder of a successful mission or the first time we           met?",
"Snake    : A reminder of how to live. Until today, I've lived only for myself.           Survival has been the only thing I cared about in my life.",
"Meryl    : That's not just you. That's how everyone is.",
"Snake    : I only felt truly alive when I was staring Death in the face. I           don't know, maybe it's written into my genes.",
"Meryl    : What about now? What do your genes say about your future now?",
"Snake    : Maybe it's time I live for someone else.",
"Meryl    : Someone else?",
"Snake    : Yeah. Someone like you... Maybe that's the real way to live.",
"Meryl    : So...where to, Snake?",
"Snake    : David. My name is David...",
"Meryl    : Okay, so where to, Dave?",
"Snake    : Hmmm. I think it's time we look for a new path in life.",
"Meryl    : A new path?",
"Snake    : A new purpose.",
"Meryl    : Will we find it?",
"Snake    : We'll find it. I know we'll find it.",
"Meryl    : What are those?",
"Snake    : Caribou. To the Aleutians, the Caribou is a symbol of life. It'll           be spring here soon...",
"Meryl    : For us too...",
"Snake    : Yeah. Spring brings new life to everything. It's a time for hope.           I've lived here a long time... But Alaska has never looked more           beautiful. The sky... the sea... the caribou... and most of all...           You...",
"Meryl    : I think I'm gonna like this new life...",
"Snake    : C'mon. Let's enjoy life...",
"Naomi    : You mustn’t allowed yourself to be chained to fate... to be ruled           by our genes. Humans can choose the type of life they want to live.           The important thing is that you choose life... And then... live!",
"Ocelot   : Yes sir. The entire unit was wiped out. Those two are still alive.",
"The vector? Yes sir, FoxDie should become activated soon... Right           on schedule.",
"Yes, sir. I recovered all of Rex's dummy warhead data. ...No, sir.           My cover is intact. Nobody knows who I really am. Yes, the DARPA           Chief knew my identity, but he's been disposed of.",
"Yes. The inferior one was the winner after all. ...That's right.           Until the very end, Liquid thought he was the inferior one. Yes,           sir. I agree completely. It takes a well-balanced individual...           such as yourself to rule the world. No, sir.  No one knows that           you were the third one... Solidus. ...What should I do about the           woman? Yes sir. I'll keep her under surveillance.",
"Yes. Thank you. Good-bye. Mr. President.",

"Campbell         : The Manhattan incident triggered a serious public backlash.                   Now the US has to think twice before intervening militarily                   in other countries' affairs. This has fueled a push towards                   military privatization, with PMCs at the heart of that                   movement.",
"Snake            : PMCs...Private Military Companies.",
"Campbell         : That's right. PMCs have no basis in nations or ideologies.                   They are private enterprises, driven by profit. In addition                   to dispatching mercenaries to war zones, they secure weapons                   and train local soldiers. They're contractors for war                   itself, and business is good. Their clientele includes                   developed nations like the US, rebel factions looking to                   seize power by force... Smaller countries lacking armies of                   their own... Even terrorist groups. They're in the Americas,                   Asia, the South Pacific, Europe, Africa, the Middle East...                   The rise of the PMC has spawned a war by proxy, and it's                   spreading across the globe.",
"Otacon           : Sunny, we'll eat them later, OK?",
"Snake            : Every age has its mercenary. These PMCs are nothing new -                   we've been dealing with them since before the turn of the                   century.",
"Campbell         : No, Snake. They're nothing like the mercenaries of the past.",
"Sunny            : They're ready.",
"Otacon           : Sorry, I'm a little busy right now.",
"Campbell         : The Pentagon's new battlefield control system has produced a                   decisive difference... Between hired guns and the PMCs of                   today. The system was developed by ArmsTech Security.",
"Snake            : ArmsTech? You mean AT Corp?",
"Campbell         : In recent years, AT Corp has shifted focus from weapons                   development to security tools. And since the establishment                   of AT Security, business has been booming. The system makes                   it possible to integrate not only micro-level information on                   individual soldiers and units, but also macro-level                   information about field conditions and order of battle.",
"Snake            : So, they've finally achieved total real-time battlefield                   control?",
"Campbell         : That's right. And as a result, the global presence of PMCs                   has grown explosively. Truth is, the rise of                   system-controlled PMCs has led to a dramatic decline in                   civilian casualties and human rights violations on the                   battlefield.",
"Snake            : A cleaner, safer battlefield. Makes for nice propaganda.",
"Sunny            : Snake, you were smoking again, weren't you? This is                   non-smoking flight!",
"Campbell         : There's more. State governments and rebel groups can't match                   the maintenance price of standing forces. PMCs, by                   comparison, are reliable, easy to use. It wasn't long before                   everybody had them on the payroll. And as a result, regular                   armies began to decline worldwide.",
"Campbell         : It's hard to believe, I know, but PMCs are beginning to                   overtake conventional armies in terms of scale. Nowadays                   it's the PMCs who serve as standard battalions. They already                   make up sixty percent of all combatant forces in zones of                   conflict.",
"Snake            : Sixty percent...",
"Campbell         : ...The fact is the world now depends largely on PMCs for                   waging its wars.",
"Snake            : I thought it was the U.N. that authorized the PMCs in the                   first place.",
"Campbell         : The U.S. abstained from voting on that resolution. In                   effect, Washington was endorsing PMCs without ever revealing                   its true intentions. Until they got wind of the uprising,                   that is.",
"Snake:           : The U.S. has exported too much military power. And now she's                   paying the price.",
"Campbell         : That's exactly it. America has now turned war into a form of                   economic activity. Analysts are calling it the                   'war economy,' in that it's picking up the slack for the                   downward-sloping oil market. But I, for one, don't intend to                   simply stand by and watch it happen. For the PMCs, market                   expansion entails fanning the flames of war... It means more                   refugees.",
"Snake            : War orphans. Child soldiers.",
"Campbell         : Yes. Even as PMC soldiers get more specialized, they're also                   getting younger.",
"Snake            : Mercenaries spun off from state armies, unmanned weapons,                   child soldiers... Proxy battles in a new Cold War.",
"Campbell         : There are hundreds of PMCs in business worldwide, and their                   numbers are growing. Currently, five of them are big enough                   to be labeled global powers two in the U.S., and one each in                   the U.K., France, and Russia. Reconnaissance has revealed                   that those five PMCs are run by a dummy corporation that                   acts as a single mother company.",
"Campbell         : This mother company embodies the five largest PMCs. Her name                   is... 'Outer Heaven.'",
"Snake            : 'Outer Heaven?' You mean...!",
"Campbell         : That's right... It's Liquid.",
"Snake            : Liquid...",
"Campbell         : He's taken command of this immense army and is now preparing                   to unleash an insurrection.",
"Snake            : I watched him die.",
"Campbell         : His will lives on - in the body of the man once known as                   Ocelot.",
"Campbell         : He aims to fan the flames of war even higher - to create the                   perfect world once envisioned by Big Boss.",
"Snake            : The one world in which soldiers will always have a place...",
"Campbell         : He must be stopped... Before it's too late.",
"Campbell         : Do you understand, Snake? Any means necessary. Just stop                   Liquid's insurrection. Even if it means...",
"Snake            : ...Killing him? You want Liquid dead. Isn't that right,                   Colonel?",
"Campbell         : I'm sorry. I know... This isn't justice. It's a covert                   assignment - a hired hit. A wet works op targeting the head                   of a major multinational corporation.",
"Snake            : Why me?",
"Campbell         : Because of the military might of the PMCs, and the effect                   they have on the economy. War is to the 21st century what                   oil was to the 20th: The pillar that supports the global                   economy. You'll recall a rather alarming report issued by                   that American think tank during the Cold War, one that                   described a new model for prepetual war. What we're facing                   now is a whole new ballgame.",
"Snake            : Iron Mountain's 'Delphi technique'...",
"Campbell         : That was fiction. It existed only on paper. The reality is                   far more serious. The global community is concerned, but                   they're all too afraid of the war economy collapsing to do                   anything about it. The U.N., too.",
"Snake            : Sounds pretty self-serving to me.",
"Campbell         : ...Snake, this mission isn't an order from Washington... not                   like the old days. And it's not something the U.N. can                   officially sanction, either.",
"Campbell:          But we can't just look the other way while Liquid plots this                   insurrection. If we fail to act, he'll become the greatest                   threat the world has ever faced.",
"Campbell         : Snake, you're the only man I can trust.",
"Snake            : Fine. Let's hear it.",
"Campbell         : Our intelligence on Liquid's uprising originally comes via                   reports from U.S. Special Forces, who were mobilized after                   we at the U.N. reported our findings. They're tracking                   Liquid's movements. About 18 hours ago, he was spotted in                   the Middle East.",
"Otacon           : There's a rebel army there in the Middle East made up of                   ethnic minorities, waging civil war against the regime in                   power.",
"Campbell         : The core of that regime's army is provided by one of the                   PMCs under Liquid's control.",
"Snake            : What about the rebels?",
"Campbell         : The local militias have hired small numbers of operators as                   trainers and field commanders. And of course they've got                   help from the local PMCs.",
"Otacon           : Right. A proxy war between hired guns.",
"Campbell         : PMC versus PMC. A quagmire of war. All-too-typical victims                   of the new world economy.

Your first objective is to                   make contact with our informants, RAT PT 01 (Rat Patrol Team                   Zero One). They'll be expecting you.",
"Snake            : Rat Patrol, huh. They sound sneaky.",

"Campbell         : ...You could say that. Transporation to the area will be                   provided under cover of a U.N. humanitarian aid mission with                   support from the U.S. military. From there on, though,                   you'll get no protection - and no guarantees - from anyone.                   And you must not leave behind any evidence of your                   involvement in that area, let alone that of the U.N.",
"Campbell         : If word of this ever leaked out, it would spark a global                   firestorm. Snake...",

"Snake            : War has changed. It's no longer about nations, ideologies,                   or ethnicity. It's an endless series of proxy battles fought                   by mercenaries and machines. War - and its consumption of                   life - has become a well-oiled machine.",

There are more of those things now in                   service than tanks. They've got tough armor plating and are                   highly agile to boot.

"Drebin           : I don't know what you're here for. But you'll wanna be                   well-equipped, am I right? So? Can we talk business or what?                   You won't regret it.",

"Otacon           : I don't particularly like the guy, but it looks like we'll                   need his help with those ID guns. Sunny's been doing a                   little sleuthing for us. Drebin. A well-known gun launderer                   in war economy circles. He's a businessman who deals mainly                   in selling black-market firearms to small PMCs and local                   militia. Somalia, the Balkans, Lebanon, Darfur, Chechnya,                   Timor, Peru, the Punjab, Kashmir, Colombia. This guy really                   gets around.",
"Snake            : How does he pull it off, anyway?",
"Otacon           : You can create a non-ID gun by replacing the ID recognition                   chip with a counterfeit version. This enables you to bypass                   the ID recognition process and use the gun. The problem is                   that there's still a record of the chip being replaced on                   the System's side. Drebin's an employee of AT Security. He                   must have connections on the inside erasing records for him.",
"Snake            : You think the Patriots are involved somehow?",
"Otacon           : I'm not so sure. If the Patriots were running the System                   from behind the scenes, then a weasel like Drebin would be a                   real pain in their collective ass.",
"Snake            : Can he be trusted?",
"Otacon           : Remember, Drebin's a green collar. He makes his living off                   the war economy. He doesn't let emotions get in the way of                   business, and he never gets his own hands dirty. The only                   thing he trusts is money. I share your concern, but what if                   we keep him at arm's length? Use him only to get intel and                   the supplies we need? Keep it strictly business.",
"Snake            : All right.",
"Drebin           : So... We ready to make a deal, or what? OK, then. Let's talk                   business. This is a war zone. There's product coming in here                   by the truckload. And you'll be picking up a lot of guns out                   in the field, I'm sure. Whatever guns you don't need, I'll                   take and buy 'em off ya. That'll earn you points you can                   cash in for services.",
"Snake            : Like what?",
"Drebin           : I'll launder your ID guns - no more locks. And I can also                   sell you the guns I've got in stock. Let me show you...",
"Drebin           : To ensure you can use non-ID guns, I'm gonna have to                   suppress the old nanomachines you've got in ya. Otherwise,                   they'll interfere with the System.",
"Drebin           : Here. Stick yourself with this. It's full of suppressor                   nanomachines.",
"Drebin           : Relax, it won't hurt. You scared of needles or something?",
"Drebin           : See? No sweat. Now you can use non-ID guns, no problem.",
"Drebin           : Hey... Be nice to our guest.",
"Drebin           : Step outside.",
"Snake            : Boo.",
"Drebin           : There, ya see? No problem. From now on, when you pick up an                   ID gun that says 'LOCKED'... You just let me know. You name                   it, I can launder it. Of course, it'll cost you. The going                   rate depends on the war price at the time.",
"Drebin           : Man, I gotta give this shit a rest.",
"Snake            : Looks like you're doing pretty well for yourself.",
"Drebin           : You might say that... What with the war economy and all...                   And the System clamping down on things. System codes are the                   law now... And control's essentially absolute... Paving the                   way for fat profits, if... You're willing to bend the law.                   Demand keeps on growing thanks to the war economy. I sell ID                   guns to the PMCs and state armies... And naked guns to to                   terrorist groups and paramilitaries. And these ID guns can't                   be sold on the black market. System's practically a license                   for us arms dealers to print money.",
"Drebin           : Privatizing the military's made the PMCs big and bloated.                   And the fatter the PMCs get, the line between civilian and                   soldier is gonna get real blurry. Sooner or later, the whole                   damn human race is gonna be green collars. More like, we're                   all gonna be fighting proxy wars. But hey... This war                   economy puts the food on my table. You're a green collar                   too, aren't ya? Yeah, it's in your eyes. You've seen a lot                   of combat.",
"Snake            : What makes you think you know me?",
"Drebin           : Nothing to be ashamed of. I'm the same way. I grew up here,                   too. I got no interest in the outside world. All right,                   then. If you need me, holler. We specialize in speedy                   service. Catch my drift?",
"Drebin           : Eye. Have. You.",
"Otacon           : I know what you're thinking, but Drebin does have a point.                   The world depends on war - on the war economy. Can you                   imagine what would happen if war just disappeared overnight?",
"Snake            : Otacon, you and Drebin both mentioned something about a war                   price earlier. What did you mean by that?",
"Otacon           : It's a kind of market price, one that fluctuates according                   to demand not only for PMCs and military industry... But for                   the production, distribution, and energy supply networks                   that support them. It's been growing by leaps and bounds,                   and investors are really starting to take notice. As the                   fighting in any given area becomes increasingly intense and                   prolonged, the war price goes up. No doubt Drebin's rates                   are linked to that war price. The longer and bloodier a                   battle becomes, the higher service prices are going to get.                   To put it another way, the quieter things are, the better                   the bargains. Snake, we'll use the Mk.II to deal with Drebin                   from here on out. He's what you might call a street vendor.                   The Mk.II can act as a kind of delivery boy -  connect you                   with him. I'm adding a 'Drebin' menu item to the Mk.II's                   Weapon menu. Whenever you pick up multiple units of the same                   weapon, any extras will automatically be sold to Drebin. Any                   ammo that's inside gets added to your cache. In other words,                   you keep the ammo, and the weapon itself gets traded to                   Drebin for points.",
"Snake            : I see.",
"Otacon           : You can then use the points you've earned to unlock ID guns                   or buy new weapons.",
"Snake            : Sounds good.",
"Otacon           : We should assume Drebin has other agents collecting guns for                   him besides you, Snake. You know, freelance green collars                   who collect weapons in exchange for services?",
"Snake            : Guess I'll have to rely on him for now.",
"Otacon           : OK. Now go meet up with our informants, Rat Patrol.",
"Militiaman       : Who's there?",
"Militiaman: Stop! Stop right there! Get back here!",
"Snake            : All right...",
"Snake            : Here.",
"Snake            : You haven't even taken the safety off, rookie.",

"Snake            : FOX...?",
"Meryl            : Snake.",
"Snake            : Meryl?",
"Meryl            : Is that you?",

"Snake            : Accelerated aging. They don't know the cause.",
"Meryl            : Oh my God...",
"Snake            : Meryl, you're my informant in the US military?",
"Meryl            : And... You must be the inspector sent by the UN.",
"Meryl            : Akiba!",
"Akiba            : Commander!",
"Akiba            : Sorry...",
"Meryl            : This is RAT PT 01 (Rat Patrol Team Zero One). We're with the                   CID (Criminal Investigation Command)... One of the bodies                   investigating PMC activity.",
"Snake            : First hounds, now rats.",

"Snake            : Stomach pains?",
"Snake            : Diarrhea...",
"Meryl            : It's been four days since Liquid arrived in the area. And                   since then, this woman's been with him.",
"Meryl            : She doesn't look like a combatant. Probably some kind of                   advisor. Maybe a scientist.",
"Snake            : So, you're the commander of this 01 unit?",
"Meryl            : Why? Something wrong with that? Here, I'll introduce you to                  the team. That's Ed, our radio man and sniper.",
"Meryl            : The sleeping giant is Jonathan.",
"Meryl            : Don't stand behind him. He hates it when people go around                   his back. And finally...",
"Meryl            : Johnny. But everybody just calls him Akiba.",
"Akiba            : Commander... I've finished installing the sensors.",
"Meryl            : OK, Akiba. Anyway...",
"Snake            : You're all grown up.",
"Meryl            : Maybe it's because someone taught me well. A certain                   legendary hero who suddenly disappeared? You quit the unit.                   Me... I never gave up on you... Or on FOXHOUND. Back then, I                   just wanted you to accept me. I wanted you to turn around                   and see who I was. But... I've put the past behind. I'm done                   playing little love games.",
"Meryl            : So... What are you here for?",
"Snake            : Threat assessment - the PMCs.",
"Meryl            : Really. Because I heard a rumor there's an assassin out                   there targeting their leader.",
"Snake            : Well, that's some rumor. I'm only here because the UN wants                   me to assess the impact and effects of PMCs on their refugee                   protection efforts.",
"Meryl            : That's all?",
"Snake            : More than enough for a retired vet like me.",
"Meryl            : I know he's plotting an insurrection. But as long as AT                   Security's System is in place, there's no way he'll succeed.",
"Snake            : How can you be so sure?",
"Meryl            : They've implemented a system that monitors in real-time                   every single soldier engaged in combat action... Whether                   he's state army or PMC. Each individual soldier has been                   fully ID-tagged with nanomachines injected into their bodies                   for that purpose.",
"Meryl            : The nanomachines keep track of the soldiers and their                   real-time personal data 24 hours a day. They monitor each                   man's position, movement, speed, reserve ammo, firing                   accuracy... Wounds, rations, water intake and supply...                   Sweat secreted, heart rate, blood pressure and sugar levels,                   oxygen... All the data gathered on body condition, on                   sensory organ data showing pain and fear... Data on every                   internal response within the body. All of it is collected by                   an AI at the System's core. This data is monitored at HQ to                   enable command to make quicker, more precise, more rational                   decisions. It also enables crisis management for each                   individual soldier. It's being used by the US military, by                   state armies in allied countries, by PMCs... Even police                   agencies are starting to adopt it. Unless they agree to                   implement the System, PMCs aren't permitted to send troops                   anywhere.",
"Snake            : You've got these System nanomachines in you, too?",
"Meryl            : Of course. Our unit plays by the rules, same as everybody                   else. It was creepy at first, knowing you're being watched                   24/7... But I've gotten used to it. It gives us a lot of                   advantages in the field, too. We get a clearer picture of                   what's going on around us, so there's less confusion during                   missions. And our nanomachines communicate with each other,                   making teamwork a lot smoother. And that's not all the                   System does for us. It's also a security guarantee against                   the PMCs.",
"Snake            : Security guarantee?",
"Meryl            : That's right. The PMCs are combat groups without states or                   ideologies. They're not fighting out of nationalism, or for                   a cause. They don't care why the war is being fought.                   They're just bodies, fighting on someone else's behalf.                   They're mercenaries. A commodity. So it's easy to imagine                   them betraying their clients by joining the enemy, or                   refusing to fight... Or committing humanitarian atrocities.                   To keep these things in check... They ensured that no one                   can use firearms or military vehicles without the proper                   System ID. It's true for every piece of equipment out there.                   So even if the PMCs tried to mount a terrorist attack or                   coup d'etat... Their weapons and equipment would                   automatically be locked out. They wouldn't be able to move,                   attack, or engage in combat of any kind. And there's more.                   All the data on their position, personnel and combat                   strength is leaked to us by the nanomachines. Even if they                   managed to circumvent the System by getting the nanomachines                   out of each soldier's body... They'd be losing their IDs in                   the process - so they couldn't use their weapons.",
"Snake            : And the Patriots are behind this?",
"Meryl            : La li lu le lo? What are you talking about?",
"Snake            : Never mind. So this System is foolproof, huh?",
"Meryl            : Completely. They call it SOP.",
"Snake            : Sons of the Patriots...",
"Meryl            : The AI that controls it is a tightly guarded secret... Both                   at ArmsTech Security - where it was developed - and at the                   Pentagon. There's no way a third party could get control of                   it.",
"Snake            : I just met a guy who said he could launder ID guns. The                   System does have holes...",
"Meryl            : There can't be more than a few hundred of those gun                   launderers. It's just a grass-roots movement. It's not like                   they can affect the entire PMC war machine. Anyway, Liquid                   would've had to register as a PMC in the System to assemble                   an army that massive. His PMCs might even exceed the US                   military in terms of numbers... But as long as they're                   registered, their soldiers' activities are constantly being                   monitored. So long as the US responds immediately when                   Liquid makes his move... We can take them down by force.",
"Snake            : By force, huh?",
"Meryl            : When ARSOC (Army Special Operations Command) heard about                   Liquid's plans... They sent us to sniff around the PMCs.                   Even with this SOP keeping an eye on things, there're always                   trouble spots to deal with in the field. Disorderly conduct,                   disobeying orders, contract violations... We act as backup                   for the System by monitoring the soldiers. PMC inspections                   are always carried out on the battlefield. That's why we're                   authorized to carry and use weapons.",
"Meryl            : We've lost five inspection teams in the past few months                   alone. They were all undercover inside Liquid's PMCs...",
"Snake            : Then... If you got caught...?",
"Meryl            : We'd be exterminated like rats. But we're smarter than that.                   We've been mingling with the PMCs... And after three months                   of searching God knows how many battlefields...",
"Meryl            : We've finally tracked him down.",
"Meryl            : When we reported that we'd found Liquid... Our superiors                   ordered us to provide the UN investigators with intel. But I                   didn't know it'd be you.",
"Snake            : Didn't the colonel tell you he was sending me?",
"Meryl            : Colonel?",
"Meryl            : Don't tell me it's Campbell.",
"Snake            : Yeah.",
"Meryl            : He put you up to this?",
"Snake            : You didn't know?",
"Meryl            : You've got to be kidding! You expect me to work with my                   uncle?",
"Snake            : Meryl!",
"Meryl            : This is bullshit! He's not my father!",
"Snake            : Meryl...",
"Snake            : So...you knew?",
"Meryl            : Yeah. Little violation of the need-to-know rule.",
"Snake            : Then... Why are you still calling him 'uncle?'",
"Meryl            : You're still calling him 'Colonel.'",
"Snake            : He's your father.",
"Meryl            : As far as I'm concerned, we're still uncle and niece. I'll                   never forgive that womanizing piece of shit.",
"Snake            : Meryl!",
"Meryl            : He... Remarried.",
"Snake            : Really?",
"Meryl            : His new wife's about my age. I hear she's even got a kid.                   It's as if he's given up on making up with his own daughter.                   Men.  Selfish, egotistical pigs.",
"Ed               : Commander!",
"Meryl            : What is it?",
"Ed               : There's 20 of them. And they're not from that PMC, Praying                   Mantis, either. It's the FROGS.",

"Meryl            : Damn!",
"Meryl            : Eye contact! These guys are with Liquid's private army.                   Shoot first, think later. We'll use the stairs and get out                   through the back door on the first floor. We'll change route                   as necessary. I'm on point. Stay close. Got it?",
"Ed & Jonathan    : Got it.",
"Meryl            : Akiba. Breathe deep.",
"Akiba            : Got it.",
"Meryl            : We've got a real live legendary hero with us. Try not to                   choke.",
"Meryl            : Move!",
"Meryl            : The nanomachine network inside each unit member's body lets                   us share each other's senses. They can see what I see. And                   it helps control pain.",
"Snake            : Is that part of the System, too?",
"Meryl            : With SOP, my team can literally operate as one. Well...",
"Meryl            : Well, except for a certain someone who's not much of a team                   player... So, what do you think? Is your age of heroes                   finally over?",
"Snake            : I'm no hero. Never was, never will be.",
"Meryl            : You haven't changed at all Snake. But... Your body... Are                   you going to be all right?",

"Otacon           : Yeah, I'm confirming the location. It's to the north of                   where you are. Meryl's really changed, hasn't she, Snake?                   She's a lot more self-assured.",
"Snake            : I wonder how much that has to do with the System. The senses                   you used to develop through extended training and experience                   can now be obtained without even working for them. Seems                   once you're under the System's control, you don't even need                   experience at all. It even beats VR training that was all                   the rage a few years back.",
"Otacon           : Yeah. The growing need for PMCs has led to the creation of a                   more reliable, cost-effective supply of elite soldiers. It's                   also made the child soldier phenomeno more problematic than                   ever.",

"Otacon           : Good question. They might provide a degree of psychological                   stability.",
"Snake            : You think so? That geek kid, Akiba - he was really starting                   to lose it.",
"Otacon           : And technologically, the System should be able to optimize                   each soldier's personality traits.",

"Otacon           : Times have changed, Snake. Just like Meryl. Snake, hurry to                   the PMC camp. Based on what Meryl told us, Liquid should be                   there.",

"Meryl            : My mission is to inspect the PMCs. I'm not in a position to                   take action. All I can do is stand by and watch. I can't                   help you. Understand? I'm a peacekeeper, here to keep order.",
"Snake            : Understood.",
"Liquid Ocelot    : Activate it.",
"Meryl            : What?",
"Akiba            : Jonathan! Commander! Commander...",
"Liquid Ocelot    : I never thought it would be so easy... But these results...                   Refreshing, don't you think?",
"Liquid Ocelot    : Brother! It's been too long!",
"Snake            : Liquid!",
"Liquid Ocelot    : Rejoice! We're not copies of our father, after all! We are                   freed of the shackles of fate! Snake! Brother... We are                   free! Watch... Snake... Watch as I surpass my own origin!",
"Snake            : Naomi?",
"Naomi            : Snake... If you won't be a prisoner to fate... Then go.                   Fulfill your destiny.",
"Akiba            : Snake! Hey...hey, are you all right? Grab on.",
"Sunny            : 11... 23... 581321... 34... 55... 89... 144... 233... 377...                   610987... 15... 97... 95... 84.",
"Sunny            : Um... Uncle Hal... The eggs... They're done.",
"Otacon           : Thank you, Sunny.",
"Sunny            : Snake!",
"Otacon           : So...back from the dead?",
"Snake            : I don't remember the sun being so flat.",
"Otacon           : Sorry. I'll dig in right away, Sunny. And would you make                   some for Snake, too?",
"Sunny            : OK.",
"Snake            : Hey... None for me, Sunny.",
"Snake            : How long was I out?",
"Otacon           : The whole day....",
"Snake            : Someone saved my life.",
"Otacon           : Yeah... It could have been Meryl and her boys. Don't                   worry... They're doing fine.",
"Snake            : Liquid got away.",
"Otacon           : You OK?",
"Snake            : My body...just seized up all of a sudden. This isn't normal.                   It's not my joints or muscles.",
"Otacon           : It looked like the PMC soldiers all went haywire en masse,                   too. I thought it might be a form of ADS (Active Denial                   System)... But I didn't detect any aberrations in the EM                   field. You were lucky. Some of those guys' hearts simply                   stopped.",
"Snake            : She was there... Naomi was at Liquid's side... Otacon, did                   you see her?",
"Otacon           : No...but you're right. Naomi was there. I found traces of                   her DNA in that syringe you were holding.",
"Snake            : So it was Naomi.... Why?",
"Otacon           : Here, let me show you something.",
"Otacon           : Right after it all happened, I got a video mail from Naomi.                   It was sent to my old address.",
"Sunny            : Um... Here you go.",
"Otacon           : Thanks, Sunny. They're delicious.",
"Sunny            : But...you haven't even eaten any.",
"Snake            : We grownups have to watch our caloric intake, you know. But                   thank you...",
"Snake            : I was looking for this.",
"Sunny            : You're not watching your nicotine intake!",
"Otacon           : Sunny!",
"Otacon           : You really hurt her feelings.",
"Snake            : Yeah? Why don't you teach her how to cook eggs, then?",
"Otacon           : Oh, like I know how to cook! Hey, check this out.",
"Otacon           : The data's been quarantined - no viruses. The voiceprint                   matches Naomi's. And I'm fairly confident that video isn't                   digitally synthesized, either.",
"Naomi            : Snake... I'll make this quick. I'm in South America. I've                   been captured and forced to do research. It's Liquid.                   Liquid's goal is to seize control of SOP... The Sons of the                   Patriots system that controls the soldiers. To do that, he                   needs to analyze the the nanomachines' structure and... Find                   out how they communicate with one another. The nanomachines                   currently in use by militaries and PMCs are third                   generation. But their design is derived from that of the                   first generation. And the basic technology is still the                   same.",
"Snake            : First generation?",
"Naomi            : I was the one who created the first generation... A                   nanomachine colony, part of which was FOXDIE. Nine years                   ago, at Shadow Moses... I injected it into your body, Snake.",
"Naomi            : The technology used in FOXDIE was incorporated... Inherited,                   really - by SOP. That's why Liquid has me helping him hijack                   the system... Because I know how FOXDIE works.",
"Naomi            : Please, you must rescue me. Liquid's found a loophole he can                   use to get in to the System. Preparations for his                   insurrection are nearly complete. There's no time to waste.                   Snake, hurry!",
"Otacon           : Naomi sent her location data in a separate file.",
"Snake            : What the hell is that?",
"Otacon           : It's a type of encrypted data. Sunny decoded it for us.                   Remember now? This is data from the Soliton Radar you used                   at Shadow Moses. I'm guessing Naomi wants us to know the                   message truly is from her.",
"Otacon           : Sending the map data in Soliton Radar format... Pretty                   clever. And Mei Ling's helping us out from Hawai'i.",
"Sunny            : The data she sent was 4-D sound data. I don't know how                   Soliton Radar works, but... All I had to do was change the                   audio data into video data... It was easy. This Naomi lady                   seems pretty cool.",
"Otacon           : It's Campbell.",
"Campbell         : Snake... As you'll recall, following the Shadow Moses                   incident nine years ago... Naomi was detained by the                   authorities. But someone arranged for her escape.",
"Snake            : Yeah, I hear they added that to my rap sheet, too.",
"Campbell         : I suspect it was actually Liquid. He must have taken her                   prisoner himself and forced her to do research at his                   facility in South America. Chances are the location Naomi                   gave us is the site of Liquid's main base.",
"Snake            : But there's no actual proof?",
"Campbell         : There's an ongoing skirmish between a new regime in power                   put into power by PMCs... And a rebel army formed by                   remnants of the old one. The rebels have hired a small-scale                   local PMC of their own to stir things up. It's the                   quintessential example of a war economy market. The new                   regime is still in shambles... So it's really Pieuvre                   Armement - one of the PMCs under Outer Heaven control -                   that's calling the shots. You might say it's a perfect place                   for Liquid to make his haven.",
"Snake            : Or it could be a trap.",
"Campbell         : True...but even so, the payoff would greatly aid our                   efforts.",
"Otacon           : I had Sunny trace the origin of Naomi's mail. The address is                   fake... But Sunny was able to track the message back through                   its proxies based on access date/time stamps and data                   transfer volumes. Apparently, the message originated from a                   server in South America. I wouldn't exactly call it 100%                   credible though.",
"Snake            : Colonel... Where's Meryl?",
"Campbell         : I know she left the Middle East in pursuit of Liquid. I'm                   sure ARSOC is on to us by now. We can't chase that line too                   far.",
"Snake            : Which leaves Naomi as our only lead.",
"Campbell         : I've secured you landing clearance at El Dorado                   International Airport. You'll be acting as a UN inspector.",
"Otacon           : South America - that's about 20 hours from here. Then what's                   the plan?",
"Campbell         : I'll arrange for them to get you a 4x4. The location Naomi                   gave us - the PMC's base - is in a mountainous region                   surrounded by forests. Use the 4x4 to get as close as                   possible to the PMC's security perimeter. From there on,                   Snake, it'll be a solo sneaking mission.",
"Campbell         : Thanks. The rebels are still pitched in battle against the                   PMCs. The commotion should help you slip into the facility                   unnoticed.",
"Snake            : 20 hours until we land. Got it. I'll have a look at the                   documents. Maybe I'll even have a smoke while I still                   can....",
"Snake            : Colonel, how deeply are they involved in all of this?",
"Campbell         : The Patriots, you mean?",
"Snake            : The data we got from Arsenal Gear was a load of crap. Twelve                   founders who've all been dead for a hundred years... Give me                   a break. We know they exist today. If the purpose of this                   battlefield control system is to control IDs, it fits in                   with their plans perfectly.",
"Campbell         : Seizing control of the world's ID systems, and then using                   them to manipulate the economy and information flow... For                   the Patriots, that's the ultimate prize. You might say the                   Patriots are the embodiment of the war economy.",
"Snake            : Everything that Solidus feared five years ago... It's all                   come to pass.",
"Solidus Snake    : The Patriots are trying to protect their power, their own                   interests... By controlling the digital flow of information.",
"Campbell         : Now with the media and global opinion under complete                   control... Not even the UN can stand up to them.",
"Snake            : Then Liquid's insurrection is against them?",
"Campbell         : Exactly. It would seem as though Liquid has taken up Big                   Boss's cause. An age of persistent, universal warfare. A                   world where mercenaries are free from domination. In a                   sense, the 'Outer Heaven' Big Boss envisioned is already a                   living reality.",
"Snake            : You mean the PMCs and their war business.",
"Campbell         : Right now, Liquid is a slave to the Patriots, forced to                   fight their proxy wars for them.",
"Snake            : He must be dying to break free of their spell.",
"Campbell         : Beneath the surface, a new cold war is brewing between                   Liquid and the Patriots over who will survive.",
"Snake            : And no matter who wins, the world has no future. Until we                   stop Liquid and destroy the System, we'll never be free.",
"Campbell         : ...Snake, what we call 'peace' is an equilibrium kept in                   check by the war economy. Destroying the System means wiping                   out the information society... The end of modern                   civilization. Like it or not, we may have no choice but to                   protract the System.",
"Otacon           : Snake, here's what we know about the current battle. Rebel                   guerilla units are advancing on the base of the government                   PMC troops.",
"Otacon           : That base appears to be Liquid's safe house. According to                   Naomi's data, she's being held prisoner inside the compound.",
"Snake            : That's where she is?",
"Otacon           : Assuming the data is correct. And one more thing...",
"Snake            : What now?",
"Otacon           : The government PMC troops have been operating at                   high-altitudes. We have reports that it's starting to upset                   the balance of the nanomachine control system.",
"Snake            : Meaning?",
"Otacon           : Meaning the low blood oxygen content seems to have an effect                   on their nanomachines, giving them a slight edge in battle.                   Be careful.",
"Snake            : Steer clear of altitude sickness. Got it.",
"Snake            : Vamp!",
"Vamp             : Beast!",
"Vamp             : Leave one.",
"Beast            : Don't forget this face.",
"Beast            : This is the face of the bastard who killed your comrades.",
"Vamp             : More guerillas will be coming to storm the safe house. He                   must be among their numbers. Sooner or later he will come.                   Don't let down your guard.",
"Beast            : Laugh... Laugh!",
"Snake            : Otacon, what the hell?",
"Otacon           : That was...Vamp! I'm sure of it. I'll never forget that                   face.",
"Snake            : Those were PMC soldiers with him. Is he involved in Liquid's                   plan?",
"Otacon           : We watched him die in Manhattan! Damn it, he won't leave us                   alone. Snake, could Vamp be immortal?",
"Snake            : Not a chance. This is the real world, not some fantasy game.",
"Otacon           : I swear, the next time he shows up...",
"Snake            : Not now, Otacon!",
"Otacon           : Right. I know. Snake, according to satellite imagery                   procured by Mei Ling, the facility where Naomi is being held                   is to the north, along a mountain road. I'm sending the                   location to your map.",
"Snake            : Mei Ling? What's she up to these days?",
"Otacon           : Taking command of the Missouri, apparently.",
"Snake            : The Missouri? That's a World War II battleship.",
"Otacon           : The museum contract in Hawai'i expired some time ago. I hear                   it's now being used as a virtual training vessel.",
"Snake            : No kidding.",
"Otacon           : Not for actual combat training, of course, but rather to get                   sailors used to seamanship on an analog vessel... Or so I                   hear. After the mess as Shadow Moses, Mei Ling kind of got                   put out to pasture.",
"Snake            : Even so, making captain at her age, that's pretty                   impressive.",
"Otacon           : Rumor has it she caught the eye of some lecherous old                   admiral who got her promoted. She always did have a thing                   for older men.",
"Snake            : Maybe it's too early to retire after all.",
"Otacon           : Thinking of taking a little training on an analog vessel,                   Snake?",
"Snake            : No. At this point, I've got no need for any more training.",
"Otacon           : Fair enough. Listen, Snake. When you get there, remember -                   the conflict between the PMCs and the rebels has nothing to                   do with your mission. There's no reason for you to get                   involved or take sides. That said, creating some sort of                   impact on the battlefield could produce better conditions                   for sneaking. The rebels are targeting the facility being                   used by the PMCs as a base. This is more or less the same                   spot where Naomi's being held. If you aid the rebels, they                   might get rid of some of the PMCs and help carve a path for                   you to sneak in.",
"Snake            : That freak I just saw, with the tentacles, was it using the                   same OctoCamo system as my suit?",
"Otacon           : Yeah.",
"Snake            : I thought that technology was of your own design.",
"Otacon           : Actually, I kind of based it on some designs Sunny snagged                   off the net.",
"Snake            : And the data came from?",
"Otacon           : DARPA.",
"Snake            : So in other words, we're on equal ground, technologically.",
"Otacon           : Sorry. I guess I should have told you.",
"Snake            : And by the looks of things, they know I'm coming, too.",
"Otacon           : Yeah. It could be a trap. Stay sharp.",
"Campbell         : Snake, there's someone I'd like you to meet - a member of                   the mission staff - a psychological counselor.",
"Snake            : Psychological counselor?",
"Campbell         : A lot of soldiers can't handle the stress of battle...end up                   panicking. She'll be useful in helping you understand the                   mindset of both the PMC and rebel soldiers.",
"Snake            : She?",
"Campbell         : Rosemary!",
"Rosemary         : Nice to meet you, Snake.",
"Campbell         : This is Rosemary. She used to work as a data analyst at the                   Pentagon, but moved to combat support during the Big Shell                   Incident.",
"Snake            : Yeah. She was in charge of Jack's files, wasn't she?",
"Campbell         : After that, she studied psychology, and now she's a                   counselor with CSP, the Combat Stress Platoon.",
"Snake            : Yeah, I hear psychological counseling's the hot field these                   days. Increased combat efficiency and productivity, all                   without ever picking up a gun.",
"Rosemary         : I'll be acting as your personal counselor on this mission.                   Since the passing of the new millennium, one of the most                   important issues facing today's military is the mental care                   of its soldiers. I can also provide advice on soldier                   psychology from a threat assessment perspective. Contact me                   anytime. I'll be standing by here at home with Roy, but I'm                   on a different circuit. The frequency is 147.79.",
"Campbell         : Her advice will have a positive effect on your Psyche Gauge.                   Survival on the battlefield depends on your psychological                   well-being. Lose your cool, and your body stops doing what                   you tell it to. Even a veteran soldier like you.",

"Campbell         : He disappeared soon after that.",
"Snake            : What about you? Jack disappeared, and you just moved in on                   Rose?",
"Campbell         : I was consoling her over her loss, and one thing just led to                   another...",

"Snake            : Now I see why Meryl was so disgusted.",
"Campbell         : Meryl said something about me?",
"Snake            : Yeah, I believe her words were, 'I'll never forgive that                   womanizing piece of shit.'",
"Campbell         : I see.",
"Snake            : Colonel, you knew she was our informant in the Middle East,                   didn't you? Was it you who put her up to it?",
"Campbell         : Yes. I used my connections in the Army to get Meryl the job.",

"Campbell         : Look, everybody involved in the incident at Shadow Moses                   either lost their job and status or, in the case of Meryl                   and Mei Ling, got brushed aside. Meryl wanted to make a                   comeback, a difference. We can't all be as strong as you,                   Snake. Some of us can't bear living like pariahs.",

Any time                   there's a mess that needs cleaning up, they're on the scene                   leading the elites.",

"Drebin           : Ever since you showed up in the Middle East, the B&B Corps                   has got orders to kill. Their number one priority is to                   eliminate some guy on sight. A guy named... Solid Snake. But                   from where I'm sitting, 'Old Snake' seems a little more                   appropriate.",

"Drebin           : They suffered shell-shock on the battlefield...                   Post-traumatic. It damaged their minds pretty much beyond                   repair... So the only way they could cope with the reality                   of battle was to become war machines themselves. The                   remnants of their human side are buried deep within. The                   beast... That's what you see on the outside. War transforms                   us, Snake... Into beasts.",

"Drebin           : But deep within that shell, something human survives. A                   fragile, scarred heart. Without a shell to protect it, it's                   like the yolk of an egg. Word going around is... Their                   natural, flesh-and-blood bodies can't survive in the open                   for more than a few minutes. And they've been convinced that                   by killing Snake, their minds will be cleansed. They think                   it's gonna free them from all the pain... And all the                   fury... And all the sorrow. Which makes these babes pretty                   much obsessed... With killing you.",

"Drebin           : Yeah, there used to be a guy by that name in the US                   military. A Russian psychic - he could control people's                   minds. I guess she inherited the title. She keeps the other                   B&Bs minds in check with her powers.",

"Drebin           : The nanomachines I got in me are different from the military                   kind. No speech restrictions for me.",
"Snake            : What the hell are these Patriots? Are they human?",
"Drebin           : Not anymore they ain't. They're the law of this world,                   created over the course of history. They're what holds this                   world together... Keeps this whole mess in check.",

"Drebin           : The Patriots are America, the world's greatest military                   power. They are the war economy. Which makes you and me just                   cogs in a much grander schematic. I mean, someone obviously                   had to start the whole thing at the beginning. But now their                   law has taken on a life of its own.",
"Snake            : A life of its own?",
"Drebin           : Yup. The country... The war economy... It ain't run by                   people. It's run by the System. No need for high-level                   decision-making authority. It's all handled by a massive yet                   simple information processing system. An AI. It works just                   like natural law. The world's a much simpler place than most                   folks realize.",
"Drebin           : Every aspect of the Patriots' System is closely monitored by                   three peripheral AIs and a core AI that ties them all                   together. The SOP System is one part of that. It's all                   backed up by a foolproof control system. So not even yours                   truly can sneak inside the Patriots' AIs.",
"Snake            : What if, hypothetically, someone found a way?",
"Drebin           : If they could fool the IDS (Intrusion Detection System)... I                   guess they could use it as a haven to lay low.",
"Snake            : Haven?",
"Drebin           : You know, like a tax haven. In the internet society, we have                   net havens, data havens.... A haven is someplace where                   social conventions and the rules of the net don't apply.                   Back in the 20th century, the super-rich would open bank                   accounts in countries without income tax laws... Not a bad                   way to evade paying taxes. Now we've got us a society where                   everybody's DNA and personal info... Is totally controlled                   by the nanomachines inside their bodies. Won't be long                   before people start using havens to escape from ID control.                   I guess you could say my gun laundering kind of borrows from                   the haven concept, after a fashion. Even so, good luck                   finding a way to access the Patriots' AIs from the outside.                   It's absolutely impossible. No chance in hell. Like I said,                   there's no breaking into those AIs... From the outside.",
"Snake            : But Liquid's got something in mind. You sure there's no way?",
"Drebin           : I'm just a gun launderer. Only reason I'm interested in you                   is 'cause you start a lot of fires.",

"Raiden           : We'll finish this later. I'll follow your trail and catch up                   with you.",

"Rosemary         : What's going on, Snake?",

"Rosemary         : Really? That's great. Snake, I have a favor to ask.",
"Snake            : What?",
"Rosemary         : Don't let him know I'm involved in this operation, OK? I                   think it would be best to just leave him alone for now.",
"Snake            : What happened between you and Jack?",
"Rosemary         : After the Big Shell Incident, he became unstable. Memories                   began to resurface from his childhood, when he fought for                   Solidus in the Liberian Civl War. And in the midst of all                   that... The baby we had together... It hadn't even been                   born yet. Jack slowly stopped coming home. And when he did,                   he'd be dead drunk, sometimes covered in cuts and bruises.                   Roy was worried. He was Jack's commanding officer, but Jack                   just avoided him. I was all alone. And Roy was so kind to                   me. He's the one who encouraged me to become a counselor. I                   know it sounds like I'm making excuses, but I needed to get                   over it - to move on with my life. I'm worried about him, of                   course, but... I'm also afraid of him.",

"Snake            : Why?",
"Naomi            : I thought he'd be the only one able to open the mail I sent.                   Not many people could recognize 4D sound data in a Soliton                   Radar file. How is the good doctor?",

"Naomi            : And if I answer your question?",
"Snake            : Let's hear it first.",
"Naomi            : Liquid... We...thought the SOP was an ID control system                   designed primarily to maintain order and control in battle.                   And we were right.",
"Naomi            : But only partially. SOP had another function... To control                   people's senses.",
"Naomi            : The nanomachines inside soldiers' bodies adapt to different                   conditions... Promoting the release of neurotransmitters,                   hormones, and stimulants, giving them an edge in battle.                   They can create an artifical combat high by releasing                   endorphins at the same time a soldier kills an enemy... Or                   they can suppress hormones to neutralize the soldier's                   emotions... Prevent them from panicking and engaging in                   friendly fire or needless massacres. It's all controlled by                   the System's core AI. It artificially controls the soldier's                   pain, emotions, senses... In other words, the essence of his                   being. The skyrocketing demands of the war economy have                   fueled the demand for more soldiers and more fighting. This,                   in turn, led to the development of technologies to rapidly                   improve their combat abilities... And control their actions.                   The System ensures a steady supply of battle-optimized                   soldiers at a minimum of cost. But you of all people must                   understand, Snake... That, unlike combat technique... A                   soldier's senses can't be taught. They must be earned                   through experience.",
"Snake            : Does this have something to do with that test of yours?",
"Naomi            : The goal was to release the soldiers' nanomachines from the                   System. But we didn't know about the mental control.",
"Snake            : And the nanomachines went berserk?",
"Naomi            : No. Our test was a success. At least, it confirmed our                   hypothesis at the time. Just as we predicted, the                   nanomachines stopped functioning, and the PMC soldiers were                   freed from the grips of the System. But the moment the                   System stopped... All the pain, and fury, and sorrow... All                   the trauma and stress, all the hatred, regret, guilt... All                   the sensations that had been suppressed were unleashed                   within their hearts. Their memories, unlike their senses,                   weren't erased. Each enemy soldier they'd killed, each lost                   comrade... Each threat of violence against the innocent...                   Every act of war they'd committed was etched firmly in their                   hearts. In suppressing the user's mind, the nanomachines                   exact a heavy burden on his heart. The user's body rejects                   the nanomachines; this reaction must then be suppressed with                   drugs. Before the user knows it, his mind is in complete                   shambles. Snake... Remember Frank?",
"Snake            : Frank Jaeger... Grey Fox.",
"Naomi            : They twisted his body for their experiments and nullified                   his broken heart with nanomachines. SOP has taken it even                   further and applied it to living human beings. The sins of                   war these soldiers carried inside them returned to assault                   them in the form of... Unimaginable shell shock. The meaning                   and the system may have changed... But the battlefield                   hasn't. Until that point, war was like a game to them. And                   then, suddenly, reality came crashing down.",
"Naomi            : Ordinarily, our hearts are hardened through experience. Even                   the most grizzled veterans live with an inescapable guilt                   they've had to overcome bit by bit through the years. And                   even then, it never truly goes away. For a mind lacking that                   essential experience, it was simply too much to bear.",
"Snake            : But what about me? I've never been under the System's                   control.",
"Naomi            : That's why I want to examine your body. You need to know,                   too. All right, Snake... Undress.",
"Naomi            : Snake, what's gotten into you? Hurry up.",
"Naomi            : Oh my God.... Snake....",
"Snake            : All right, let's just get this over with.",
"Naomi            : Yes... Of course. I'm sorry.",
"Naomi            : Snake, do you remember what I told you in my video mail?                   About the first generation of nanomachines?",
"Snake            : The ones you stuck me with at Moses?",
"Naomi            : Yes... The nanomachines are recharged by your body heat.                   They won't stop functioning until they're all extracted...                   Or until you do. Most of them were lost through bleeding and                   excretion... But around 30% still remain inside your body,                   attached to your cells. The first generation were never                   ID-registered, so they don't react the same way as the SOP                   nanomachines. But they may be interfering with your body,                   and with your heart.",
"Snake            : So does the aging have something to do with FOXDIE, too?",
"Naomi            : No. Your telomeres were intentionally set up to be short,                   regardless of the age of the original. One of the genes that                   inhibit reproduction and aging - the Klotho gene - was                   intentionally mutated as well. But more importantly, your                   chromosomes, like Liquid's... Were provided with terminator                   genes to prevent them from making copies.",
"Snake            : Why?",
"Naomi            : You are clones created for one purpose - war. And so in                   order to prevent you from being abused by clients or stolen                   by the enemy... They shortened your lifespan and removed                   your ability to reproduce. It was a safety device to ensure                   that the seed of Big Boss didn't end up in the hands of                   others. The reason you're aging so rapidly isn't because of                   disease, or faulty research, or FOXDIE. It's how you were                   born. It's your natural lifespan.",
"Snake            : The truth, Naomi. How long is my body going to hold out?",
"Naomi            : Your cells, blood, organs, nerves, skeletal system, muscle                   tissue... Every part of your body is aging rapidly. An                   ordinary man wouldn't even be standing by now.",
"Naomi            : Snake, the only thing keeping you together is your strength                   of your will.",
"Snake            : How long do I have?",
"Naomi            : ...Half a year.",
"Naomi            : Don't. Snake. There's something I have to tell you.",
"Snake            : Now what?",
"Naomi            : You and I both know your body is approaching its limit. When                   I said another half a year, I wasn't talking about your                   lifespan.",
"Snake            : What do you mean?",
"Naomi            : We can't get rid of the FOXDIE in your body completely. At                   this point, it's circulating within you like a normal virus.",
"Snake            : Yeah, so?",
"Naomi            : Listen to me. FOXDIE only kills its victims when the                   infected person's genetic code... Fully matches the genetic                   sequence programmed into the virus's receptors. In other                   words... It only attacks targets with specific genes.",
"Snake            : I know. That's what killed the AT president... And Liquid.",
"Naomi            : Yes. And at the same time, it's set up to protect those not                   designated as targets from the virus's harmful effects.                   Here... I'll show you. The receptors on the FOXDIE inside                   your body are breaking down. The rapid aging process is                   changing the environment within your body. As a result, the                   virus is starting to mutate.",
"Naomi            : The viruses on the left are FOXDIE in its original form. The                   ones on the right I took from your body. They're already                   mutated. The receptors - they're wearing down.",
"Snake            : Meaning?",
"Naomi            : This mutated version of FOXDIE could activate... Even if the                   infected person's genetic pattern doesn't perfectly match                   the receptors. Which means the virus is becoming                   indiscriminate about what type of target it kills.",
"Naomi            : Ever since Shadow Moses... FOXDIE has been breeding                   continuously in the nanomachine colony inside your body and                   dispersing into the air. But there are no more targets to                   attack, so there haven't been any more outbreaks.",
"Naomi            : However, if the receptors continue to wear down... It'll                   become a killer virus that attacks untold numbers of                   victims.",
"Snake            : What if we kill them all - remove them from the body?",
"Naomi            : There are no antibodies, either. I don't know what                   percentage of the receptors have to break down, or how many                   people will be targeted when that happens. What is certain                   is that people will begin to catch FOXDIE through airborne                   transmission. It'll start with those closest to you... Then,                   one by one, they'll lose their lives. The part of the virus                   that distinguishes between individuals will start to break                   down in about...",
"Snake            : Half a year.",
"Naomi            : No... Three months at the most.",
"Snake            : Three months!",
"Naomi            : Ironic, isn't it? You've spent your entire life saving the                   world from Metal Gear - from nuclear annihilation. And                   now... You're becoming a doomsday device yourself. I can't                   predict exactly how devastating the epidemic will be.                   Whether just one percent of the human race could unlock the                   broken receptors... Or whether we all can. In either case,                   three months from now you'll be a walking biological weapon.                   If it were up to me, you'd be quarantined already.",
"Snake            : It's not over yet.",
"Naomi            : I know. You still have a job to do. You have three months.                   Still enough time to think once all of this is done with.",
"Snake            : And if I choose death first...? Will that stop FOXDIE from                   spreading?",
"Naomi            : When the host dies... The virus dies with it.",
"Naomi            : Snake... Tell me one more thing. Have you been to a hospital                   lately?",
"Snake            : Yeah.",
"Naomi            : While you were there, did they give you an injection?",
"Snake            : Don't they always?",
"Naomi            : Take a look at this. These came out of your body as well.                   It's a new strain of FOXDIE... One I've never seen before.                   Someone must have put them in you recently. Do you have any                   idea who?",
"Snake            : Him!",
"Naomi            : The new FOXDIE strain is starting to multiply rapidly.",
"Snake            : What's in it?",
"Naomi            : I can't say for sure. I'll need to do some more tests. Here,                   take this.",
"Naomi            : It contains the same substance the soldiers' nanomachines                   secrete inside their bodies. It's a drug that inhibits the                   nanomachines' ability to regulate the senses. The                   nanomachines inside the body malfunction when the System                   interferes with tem. It triggers a reaction in the body,                   which is why you're having the seizures. Give yourself a                   shot whenever they get bad.",
"Naomi            : It's potent, so use it sparingly... Unless you want to end                   up an invalid. It may restore your Psyche for a short                   while... But use it too often and the amount restored will                   start to decrease.",
"Naomi            : I've been a fool. I let myself drown in my nanomachines, and                   now I'm trapped by them.",
"Snake            : You said yourself we mustn't allow ourselves to be chained                   to fate.",
"Naomi            : I can't slip free.",
"Snake            : Then I'll free us both. Where's Liquid?",
"Naomi            : I can't tell you yet. Not until you free me.",
"Snake            : Do you even know?",
"Naomi            : Liquid left here last night.",
"Snake            : Where was he headed?",
"Naomi            : Those are my terms. I can't leave this place of my own will.",

"Naomi            : I'm being... Watched.",
"Naomi            : Liquid has altered his plan. Removing the System will only                   cause his army to collapse from within. So he's chosen to                   seize control instead. Liquid's objective is to hijack the                   SOP System. He'll use it to create the ultimate army of                   perfect soldiers and launch his insurrection against the                   Patriots. There's a name for his new plan. He calls it                   'Guns of the Patriots.'",

"Drebin           : The camo skullcap you just picked up from Tentacle's shell.                   It utilizes the same kind of technology as your OctoCamo                   suit. Using the two together can get you even better                   results. I'd hang onto it if I was you.",

"Drebin           : Yeah. Looks like it could use a bit of tailoring before you                   can sport it. Not my line of work, but... Ain't you got a                   buddy who specializes in that kind of thing?",

"Drebin           : Look, you do know there are other folks who could've done                   this to you. And besides, what would I gain from infecting                   you? Better for me that you're out there kicking ass on the                   battlefield. I was watching you, Snake. You're a real piece                   of work. Never thought I'd meet the man who could take down                    Laughing Octopus single-handedly. She just kept on laughing.                   Now why do you suppose that is?",
"Snake            : Something in her past?",
"Drebin           : You got it. She's from a village in Scandinavia - little                   seaside hamlet known to all the locals as the Devil's                   Village. Place wasn't known for devils, though. It was known                   for octopus. See, this was one of the few places in Europe                   where they ate octopus customarily. Anyway, there's this                   cult of crazies who for some reason hate the village, with a                   passion. Then, when she was just a teenager, things get bad.                   These nutcases get their hands on some weapons and attack                   the village. Overnight, her sleepy little fishing town                   becomes a war zone. The round up all the villagers and                   execute them one by one. Except for that girl. They had                   something else planned for her, something a whole lot worse                   than dying. Calling her the Devil's Child, they forced her                   to do the kind of thing you'd expect from one of Lucifer's                   own. After they made her torture her family and friends,                   they made her kill 'em. The whole time they were forcing her                   to laugh, howl like some sort of demon. Like she was                   enjoying it. What was she gonna do, say no? They'd kill her,                   too. So she let fear take control, and did exactly as they                   told her. She butchered the bodies of the ones she loved,                   and laughed while she did it. And as she bathed in their                   blood, it gradually turned from deep red to jet black. To                   her, it looked like the ink of an octopus. The experience                   scarred her deep. Ever since then, she hasn't stopped                   laughing. Only, that ain't really laughter.",
"Snake            : Why are you telling me this? You expect me to feel sorry for                   her?",
"Drebin           : Nah. I know you got no room for that stuff in your world.                   And besides, this is war... Right? In a way, though, I guess                   it was the right thing to do.",
"Snake            : What was?",
"Drebin           : Fighting you cleansed her mind. All right, enough chit-chat.                   There's other beasts out there in them woods. Watch your                   back.",
"Raiden           : Snake, have you lost sight of the target? Whenever something                   moves, it leaves a trail behind. Track and find Naomi's                   trail.",
"Snake            : I'm not like Big Boss. Tracking isn't my strongest suit.                   When did you get so good at it?",
"Raiden           : After saving Sunny, I drifted around the globe. In Alaska, a                   tribal elder taught me some scouting techniques.",

"Raiden           : Rose? She doesn't exist. No. Rose and I live in different                   worlds, different times. Her world has no place for someone                   like me. My place is here on the battlefield. Listen, Snake,                   scouting is based on the principles of hunting. There are                   two fundamentals: awareness and tracking.",
"Snake            : Awareness?",
"Raiden           : Awareness refers to locating a trail by paying careful                   attention to your surroundings. Tracking means to follow                   that trail. Your target's trail could be footprints, a                   branch they broke along the way, bent grass trampled                   underfoot. You need to feel for clues using all your senses                   - sound, smell, touch, the direction of the wind. Watch how                   the animals move. Listen for unusual bird calls. These are                   signs that someone may be disrupting the environment nearby.",
"Snake            : You sound like a ninja.",
"Raiden           : Exactly. Ninja are the ultimate scouts. If your enemy is a                   skilled scout, they'll be doing the same thing. You may be                   the hunter, but you are also the hunted. To avoid enemy                   detection, move slowly, little by little. Don't disturb the                   air around you. Try to make as little noise as possible.                   Your pursuers will be doing the same, trying to sneak up on                   you without a sound. If you can't pick up the trail with                   your naked eye, switch the Solid Eye to infrared (NV) mode.                   That will enable you to see Naomi's footprints and any                   enemies lying in ambush.",
"Snake            : Switch the Solid Eye to infrared (NV). Got it.",
"Raiden           : But the sound it makes while engaged could end up giving                   your position away. So don't leave it on for too long.",

"Raiden           : Snake, these PMCs have received some degree of scout                   training. They can detect the low sound of the Solid Eye,                   even though it's faint.",
"Snake            : So if I'm wearing the Solid Eye and get too close, it'll                   give my postion away.",
"Raiden           : Exactly. Switch it off when approaching the enemy.",
"Raiden           : You need to look at more than just the shape of the                   footprints. Don't assume you're on the right track just                   because the print matches the target's shoes. Take a closer                   look. Imagine the target actually on top of the print.                   Think. Is the depth of the print consistent with Naomi's                   weight? Does the stride, straddle, and pitch match her walk?                   Pay attention. Don't let the hunted fool the hunter.",
"Snake            : Otacon, it's Vamp. I'm sure of it.",
"Otacon           : Yeah...and they're taking Naomi away.",
"Liquid Ocelot    : Do it now, before we're interrupted again.",
"Vamp             : We don't know what will happen. Remember the last time....",
"Liquid Ocelot    : I'm willing to make a few sacrifices.",
"Vamp             : As you wish. We'll begin shortly.",
"Vamp             : We've got the go-ahead. Begin. We'll use his blood. It could                   get intense... Brace yourselves.",
"Vamp             :  Shots, all of you.",
"Vamp             : I'll be taking a nap....",
"Naomi            : Snake! The syringe! Snake!",
"Naomi            : It's not working... The emotional controls aren't stable                   enough yet.",
"Naomi            : Snake!",
"Drebin           : Need a lift?",

"Naomi            : Yeah.",
"Drebin           : Ah shit.",

"Snake            : Naomi, go on ahead.",
"Otacon           : I'm sorry... I'm a little busy right now.",

"Snake            : Naomi, take care of this.",
"Naomi            : All right.",
"Snake            : Otacon, get us out of here!",

"Raiden           : No. I just don't fear death.",
"Vamp             : Yes... Could you be the one to finally finish me?",
"Snake            : Raiden! You OK?",
"Raiden           : Fine.",
"Snake            : Raiden!",
"Naomi            : You're....",
"Vamp             : Boss, she got away. Are you sure about this?",
"Liquid Ocelot    : It's all part of the plan.",
"Vamp             : The test was a failure. Even with his code.",
"Liquid Ocelot    : As I feared. It's not pure enough. We need all of him.",
"Vamp             : The PMCs we deployed have suffered brain damage. Nothing                   salvageable remains. Our only remaining option is to secure                   the original.",
"Liquid Ocelot    : I know that. It's only a matter of time. We're working as                   fast as we can to find their hiding place. I need you here                   too, Vamp.",
"Naomi            : Hang in there!",
"Otacon           : Vamp...he's got to be immortal.",
"Naomi            : No. He's not immortal at all. It was my design that caused                   his body to be like that.",
"Otacon           : Huh?",
"Snake            : What do you mean?",
"Naomi            : The nanomachines in his body cause his wounds to close and                   heal at an accelerated rate. Someone took the basic                   nanomachine technology I once researched and perfected it.                   In a sense, I'm responsible for Vamp. He's one of my sins.",
"Snake            : Does your body have the same nanomachines?",
"Naomi            : I brought a monster into this world... And I, too, am....",
"Naomi            : Hold him down!",
"Naomi            : He's losing too much blood.",
"Snake            : Can you save him?",
"Naomi            : I don't know. He needs a blood transfusion... No, an                   infusion of artificial blood....",
"Raiden           : Snake....",
"Snake            : Raiden!",
"Raiden           : Europe... Go meet... Big Mama.",
"Sunny            : Argon... Boron... Silicon and neon... Ebrium... Fermium...                   Plutonium... Chlorine... Fluorine... Gallium and xenon...                   Thallium, strontium...",
"Naomi            : The trick is to keep the lid on.",
"Naomi            : Now, let it cook for one minute. You like cooking, don't                   you? Good for you.",
"Sunny            : This is my Sunny-side-up fortune telling. When it turns out                   good, it means something good is going to happen.",
"Naomi            : So that's why you don't cook them over easy.",
"Naomi            : But the secret to good cooking is to keep who's going to eat                   it in mind. Oh...",
"Naomi            : Is this your mother?",
"Sunny            : Yes.",
"Naomi            : She's really beautiful.",
"Sunny            : Uh huh.",
"Naomi            : That tune you were humming...it's from the periodic table,                   isn't it?",
"Naomi            : Thorium, protactinium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium,                   americium...",
"Naomi            : Americium... Uh...",
"Sunny & Naomi    : Curium!",
"Naomi            : Curium.",
"Sunny            : Curium.",
"Naomi            : That's it. Curium!",
"Naomi            : Oh, this? May I?",
"Naomi            : There.",
"Naomi            : See Sunny? Us girls have to look our best.",
"Sunny            : Her name...was Olga.",
"Naomi            : Hmm?",
"Sunny            : My mother.",
"Naomi            : Oh... I see.....",
"Naomi            : It's going to burn.",
"Naomi            : Hold on. And... There. Done!",
"Sunny            : Thanks....",
"Naomi            : Of course. We did a great job.",
"Naomi            : Dr. Emmerich...Liquid is in Eastern Europe. He's after the                   corpse of Big Boss.",
"Otacon           : Huh? What for?",
"Naomi            : It's the final key he needs to gain access to SOP. The keys                   to the System are Big Boss's genetic code and biometric                   data. Without them, there's no way to gain access.",
"Otacon           : Wait. What's Liquid been doing all this time?",
"Naomi            : He's been performing tests. Two tests... The first, using                   the genetic code from Liquid's DNA chip. In his second                   attempt, he used the DNA code and biometric data extracted                   from Snake's blood.",
"Snake            : What's the need for the original if a substitute works just                   as well?",
"Naomi            : Neither your genetic pattern nor Liquid's genetic pattern is                   a 100% match for Big Boss's.",
"Snake            : What do you mean we don't match?",
"Naomi            : Dr. Emmerich. Scientifically speaking, there's the markers                   implanted during the cloning process... The mixing of                   mitochondrial DNA within the egg cell... The intentionally                   altered terminate...",
"Naomi            : Terminator genes... Scientifically speaking. Both you and                   Liquid are as similar to Big Boss as you could possibly be.                   But you're still different.",
"Otacon           : Different?",
"Naomi            : Yes.",
"Snake            : So that's what Liquid was talking about?",
"Liquid Ocelot    : We're not copies of our father, after all!",
"Naomi            : Which is why they created Solidus.",
"Snake            : But Solidus is dead.",
"Naomi            : Listen carefully, Snake. This is the most important part...                   The AI that controls the System employs a hightly                   aggressive, advanced IDS.",
"Naomi            : It uses a special code to inspect all data and commands                   circulating within the network. Any data that fails to                   confirm to that code is treated as a foreign object and                   expunged... Like viruses killed by white blood cells. The                   authentication program this IDS uses is based on a genetic                   identification program...",
"Naomi            : One I helped develop for FOXDIE. It's set up so that host                   commands only execute properly if the key matches perfectly.                   However... If the IDS suspects someone is trying to break                   into the System... It registers that genetic code on a                   blacklist.",
"Naomi            : That code is then blocked, and can never again be used to                   access the System. So, if you're going to use a substitute,                   you need to find a new genetic access code with each new                   trial.",
"Snake            : So when Liquid accessed the System in the Middle East and                   South America... It was only a test.",
"Otacon           : I can't believe this. Snake and Big Boss don't have the same                   genetic code?",
"Naomi            : Strictly speaking, Snake and Liquid aren't the same, either.",
"Naomi            : Which is why FOXDIE only affected Liquid at Shadow Moses...                   And spared you. Let's put it this way... If Liquid uses Big                   Boss's genetic code... The original... He'll have the System                   completely under his control.",
"Snake            : Hold on. I thought having his code wasn't enough. You need                   his biometric data at the same time, don't you?",
"Otacon           : That's right! And Big Boss is already dead.",
"Naomi            : No. He's alive.",
"Snake            : Big Boss is... Alive?",
"Naomi            : His body is. Or rather... His cells.",
"Snake            : That's impossible!",
"Naomi            : Big Boss survives as a biomort... A brain-dead shell                   sustained in a lab.",
"Naomi            : Liquid has already left for Europe in search of Big Boss's                   body. Right from the start, he knew his experiment in South                   America wasn't going to work.",
"Snake            : Europe, huh?",
"Vamp             : The test was a failure. Even with his code.",
"Liquid Ocelot    : As I feared. It's not pure enough. We need all of him.",
"Vamp             : Our only remaining option is to secure the original.",
"Naomi            : If Liquid obtains the body, he'll be primed to make his                   final move.",
"Snake            : Allowing him total control of the System.",
"Naomi            : Exactly. Unless we can stop him first.",
"Sunny            : Uncle Hal, I found it!",
"Otacon           : This is it.",
"Snake            : Where'd you hack this from?",
"Otacon           : AT Security... The Patriots.",
"Naomi            : I can't believe this sort of thing still goes on...",
"Otacon           : The war economy is heating up the R&D race.",
"Otacon           : It's not just the PMCs, either. Every corporation tethered                   to the military-industrial complex is losing its sense of                   morality. And it's us science-holics who are doing their                   dirty work for them... Not even realizing it.",
"Sunny            : Can we make Jack better?",
"Otacon           : I don't know.",
"Naomi            : Sunny. May I?",
"Naomi            : It's no use. There's nothing we can do here.",
"Sunny            : Hmm? What do you mean?",
"Naomi            : Look at this.",
"Naomi            : His artificial blood needs dialysis. We don't have the                   proper equipment.",
"Sunny            : Dialysis?",
"Naomi            : Getting his wounds healed is important, too. But at this                   rate... He's not going to last that long.",
"Sunny            : Dialysis...is that like what kidneys do?",
"Naomi            : That's right. Raiden's blood is an older type of artificial                   blood that was used by the military... Called white blood.                   After it's been in use for a while, the blood needs to be                   dialyzed... Filtered. Right now, he's slipping into                   autotoxemia.",
"Raiden           : It's there... In Europe...",
"Naomi            : What do you mean?",
"Raiden           : Eastern Europe. They have equipment that can heal me there.",
"Snake            : Where? The same place Liquid went?",
"Raiden           : Dr. Madnar. He saved my life.",
"Naomi            : Dr. Madnar. I've heard of him.",
"Otacon           : A world-renowned cybernetics expert. Strictly underground,                   though.",
"Naomi            : We're in luck, then. It's settled. We must head for Europe.                   The sooner we get there, the better.",
"Otacon           : I'll call Campbell and have him get us landing clearance.",
"Otacon           : Snake? Where're you going?",
"Snake            : Well, I'm gonna be spewing out poison soon enough anyway.                   What's one more smoke gonna hurt?",
"Sunny            : Uh-uh! This is a no-smoking flight!",
"Naomi            : Who is this?",
"Otacon           : Oh, her? That's my sister.",
"Naomi            : Really? I never knew you had a sister. For a moment I                   thought she might have been your girlfriend.",
"Otacon           : No! I don't have a... Emma was a brilliant programmer. She                   wrote the worm that destroyed the Arsenal Gear AI. Then...                   Vamp killed her.",
"Naomi            : I'm so sorry.",
"Otacon           : No! There's nothing for you to be sorry for. Or me. I used                   to be an anime otaku.",
"Naomi            : Oh. So that's where 'Otacon' comes from.",
"Otacon           : I was always fascinated by sci-fi anime. That's what got me                   into this line of work. It's too bad reality wasn't so                   simple. I never even imagined that science... That my own                   research... Could cause so much misery.",
"Otacon           : I mean, it's not like us science-holics are Satanists or                    anything. But... Even when we've got the best of                    intentions... We end up being used by others for evil.",
"Naomi            : Dr. Emmerich...I...",
"Otacon           : You see this? Sunny helped me build it.",
"Naomi            : Really? Sunny helped build this?",
"Otacon           : We built it using top-secret docs and patents dug up from                   intranets at a bunch of research labs. To tell you the                   truth, I think she's better at it than I am.",
"Naomi            : But she's just a child.",
"Otacon           : She cracked the protection on your mail.",
"Naomi            : Wow. I assumed it was you....",
"Otacon           : Sunny was taken by the Patriots right after she was born.                   She never even met her parents. She's spent her entire                   childhood inside the net.",
"Naomi            : That's why she has trouble speaking....",
"Otacon           : Her home is in the computer. She can only see the outside                   from the inside. She's always in there... Searching for                   herself... Searching for her family. She's trying to find                   out who she is... And where she's going.",
"Naomi            : Searching for herself... And her family...",
"Otacon           : She believes she can find the answers inside a machine                   hooked up to the world. She spends every day inside the net,                   exploring. For Sunny, this is home.",
"Naomi            : No. It shouldn't be like that.",
"Otacon           : What?",
"Naomi            : It's time you let her go outside.",
"Otacon           : What are you talking about?",
"Naomi            : She hasn't even been born yet. She's still in the womb. She                   needs to live a real life.",
"Otacon           : But...Sunny's never shown any interest in leaving the Nomad.                   Frankly, I'm worried about letting her go out there.",
"Naomi            : I have a feeling she'll do just fine.",
"Otacon           : You really think she'll be OK going outside?",
"Naomi            : That's not what I meant... I think she's got a good handle                   on her science.",
"Otacon           : Sorry. Go on.",
"Naomi            : Huh?",
"Otacon           : You were about to say something.",
"Naomi            : Oh... Right... Would you mind if I help Sunny with her                   cooking?",
"Otacon           : Of course not. Go ahead... But...about all we've got on                   board besides military rations are eggs.",
"Naomi            : No. Leave them off. It makes you look handsome.",

"Campbell         : Snake, you'll be infiltrating the region where they are                   believed to house their base of operations. It looks as if                   the PMCs moved swiftly, cutting off Big Mama and company's                   escape routes. They should still be hiding somewhere in that                   area. Big Boss's corpse is bound to be with them. You've                   been added to the PMCs' blacklist, so you're going to have                   to lie about your identity to get in. I've provided you with                   a way to evade the checkpoints. Make contact with the                   resistance and find Big Mama. This is our last chance.

The President's finally realized the danger Liquid's little                   rebellion poses, and has called for immediate action. Now                   I've got more bodies than I know what to do with - a whole                   joint Army-Marines team.

But first we've got to find Big Mama. Snake, let's go                   over what we know so far. The streets are under curfew.

"Otacon           : The PMCs have laid a dragnet for resistance members that                   covers the entire town. They're using SOP to notify each                   other by radio of any info collected during their searches.                   By intercepting those signals, you should be able to reach                   the resistance members' location in real time.",

When you've got                   the Signal Interceptor equipped and you hear the PMCs                   chatter about the resistance, check your map.

"Big Mama         : 40 years ago. During the Cold War, when the United States                   and the Soviet Union were still at odds. It was in that                   chaotic era that the Patriots were born. And I played my                   part. I was one of the founding members.",
"Snake            : You?",
"Big Mama         : Zero created the Patriots to manage and control the American                   state. That control endured long after the Cold War ended.                   The organization became an empty shell, continuing to                   fucntion through AIs. Those AIs are responsible for the                   creation of the war economy... And they gave rise to the                   Sons of the Patriots system. But I am partly to blame. I                   bear some of the guilt for creating the organization. It was                   right after I first met your father... Big Boss.",
"Big Mama         : Back in 1964, I was ordered to take part in a CIA op called                   Operation Snake Eater... Which concerned a new weapon the                   Soviets were developing at the time. My mission was to                   support a certain agent. That agent later became Big Boss...                   But I knew him as Snake.",
"Snake            : Snake?",
"Big Mama         : Yes. Naked Snake. That was his code name at the time. A name                   he would give to you... His son. The commander of this                   mission was a man called Zero, the head of Special Forces                   unit FOX. Back then, I was working as a double agent for the                   Chinese. My objective was to secure the location of the                   Philosophers' Legacy... A massive cache of hidden wealth,                   and report it to Beijing. I was to acquire a microfilm                   showing the location of secret funds... Funds amassed by the                   Allied powers during World War II. But I failed in my                   mission, and was expelled from China. I took the apple from                   the Snake... And was cast out of Eden. After years on the                   run I ended up in Hanoi - that's where I met him again. It                   was around then that Zero used the massive funds contained                   in the Philosophers' Legacy... To start a new organization -                   the Patriots... Which would carry out the final wishes of a                   certain legendary hero. The initial membership consisted of                   Big Boss, Sigint, Para-Medic... And their commander - Zero.                   Oh, and there was one more who we mustn't forget. He stayed                   behind in the Soviet Union to support the group as an                   informant. Ocelot... Who is now Liquid. After your father                   rescued me in Hanoi, I went to America and join their                   organization. Zero's goal was to achieve a unity of thought                   and awareness. He believed that was what The Boss wanted...                   And the rest of the Patriots followed his lead.",
"Snake            : The Boss?",
"Big Mama         : The Boss was a legendary hero from the Second World War                   known as the Mother of Special Forces. She had an almost                   overwhelming charisma about her. The CIA feared this, so                   they had her eliminated. If she had survived, the world of                   the 21st century might have been a very different place. We                   were all influenced by The Boss's will. It was what drove us                   to create this organization - to be closer to that spirit.                   Zero decided that in order to lead the people, we needed a                   special kind of icon. So we turned to Big Boss, the last son                   of The Boss. He shared more of her life than anyone else. It                   was Big Boss, the true heir to her legacy, who was best                   suited to play this role.",
"Big Mama         : Zero elevated Big Boss - the hero who saved the world - to                   the status of an idol. The truth behind Big Boss became                   riddled with exaggeration, misrepresentation, and outright                   lies. Zero disseminated these stories among the masses and                   gathered the rich and powerful to his banner. Every era                   needs its symbols to control the people... Whether it be the                   Stars and Stripes... Or the Hammer and Sickle.",
"Big Mama         : As the times and currents of politics changed, so too did                   Zero. Eventually, he became a prisoner of his own lust for                   power... Sparking friction between him and Big Boss, who                   resented playing the puppet. With Big Boss drifting away,                   Zero realized he would need insurance. Something that would                   perpetuate the existence of Big Boss, their organization's                   icon. And so, Zero secretly embarked on a new project: Les                   Enfants Terribles. Its goal was to create a clone of Big                   Boss, the ultimate soldier. The project was led by Dr.                   Clark, known at the time as Para-Medic. After dozens of                    failures, they finally - miraculously... Succeeded in                   producing a fertilized egg. The egg used in the successful                   in vitro fertilization came from Dr. Clark's assistant... A                   heathly Japanese woman.",
"Vulcan Raven     : Blood from the East flows within your veins....",
"Big Mama         : 'Give birth to Big Boss.' To realize this, I asked to serve                   as the surrogate mother... And was more than happy to carry                   you in my womb. I loved him. Nine months later, I gave birth                   to two Big Bosses... You, and Liquid. It didn't matter that                   you were clones, or that they had manipulated your DNA. You                   were born the same way as any other normal child... From                   your mother's womb. But Les Enfants Terribles proved to be                   the final straw for Zero and Big Boss. Determined to oppose                   Zero and his plans, Big Boss broke away from the Patriots.                   He left the States, created his own mercenary company, and                   drifted around the world. I'm sorry... Your father never                   wanted you. Human life isn't meant to be manipulated like                   that. I knew that. But I wanted you. After Big Boss left,                   Zero really lost control. What Zero wanted was an orderly                   world, one governed by rules. His fortune grew through                   countless wars... And his words influenced decision-making                   all the way up to the Oval Office. As the world saw the rise                   of digital technology... IT, the internet, and genetics...                   The Patriots' power grew immense. Their roots spread and                   took hold throughout the globe. In time, they began to                   dictate the fate of entire nations from the shadows. And                   before we knew it... The Patriots - the proud police of the                   world... Started bringing an entire planet under their                   control.",
"Big Mama         : Their intentions were fair. But their execution was flawed.                   Zero developed weapons, amassed armies... Used information                   for extortion - all in order to gain more wealth. He was                   obsessed with controlling awareness on the inside from the                   outside. But... I cannot imagine that's what The Boss would                   have wanted. They both misinterpreted her will. And their                   absolute reverence for her drove them apart. So began the                   war between Zero and Big Boss. Opposing interpretations...                   Each striving to realize The Boss's will. Everything you see                   today stems from their cold war... Differences in race... In                   religion... In ideology. This war they've caused is no                   different from any other human error in history. It all                   started with a tiny fork in the path... And grew into a                   great rift.",
"Big Mama         : There was nothing left of The Boss's noble will in their                   struggle. All that remained was hatred - a passion to                   destroy one another. Big Boss returned to the US with a plan                   in mind, and once again assumed command of FOXHOUND. In                   Outer Heaven, and then Zanzibarland... Big Boss plotted                   coups d'etat against Zero. But you - Solid Snake, his own                   clone - foiled his efforts both times. Big Boss and Gray Fox                   - Frank Jaeger - were left near death. Zero recovered their                   bodies. Frank Jaeger's entire body was reconstructed through                   surgery... And he was reborn as the Cyborg Ninja. Big Boss,                   now a vegetable, became a prisoner of Zero even in death.                   For Zero, more than anyone else... Your father was an                   irreplaceable icon. No, the truth is, for Zero... He was an                   irreplaceable friend. After Big Boss's betrayal, Zero could                   no longer believe in something so uncertain as life. He lost                   his belief in everything - nations, organizations,                   individuals. Zero was no longer willing to place his                   organization in the hands of the next generation. Instead,                   he set up a network of AIs... A decision-making system                   formed from all the information he had accumulated. He built                   four AIs... GW, TJ, AL, and TR - as sort of a digital Mount                   Rushmore. And one core artificial intelligence to unite them                   - John Doe.",
"Snake            : GW? The same GW we destroyed five years ago?",
"Big Mama         : The same. Ever since GW was cut off... JD and the other                   three AIs have controlled all information on every aspect of                   global society... Economics, politics, law, morals and                   culture. The war economy is no exception. In the shadow of                   the System and its complete control over the world... Big                   Boss isn't allowed to live or die. He's trapped for eternity                   in a brain dead prison. To bind himself to his friend -  to                   ensure his rule over the world... Zero transformed Big Boss                   into an icon, neither living nor dead.",
"Snake            : Sounds almost like a religion.",
"Big Mama         : Naturally, Ocelot and I planned to free him from Zero's                   prison. We enlisted Naomi Hunter, an authority in the field                   of nanomachine research, into our organization. And we used                   Frank Jaeger to kill Dr. Clark. Ocelot tortured the DARPA                   Chief, Donald Anderson - also known as Sigint - to death...                   And made it look like an accident.",
"Snake            : The Shadow Moses Incident....",
"Big Mama         : With Para-Medic and Sigint dead, Zero was the only one left.                   But we, too, paid a price. I lost Ocelot. Ocelot wasn't                   fighting for the Pentagon, or the Russians. And certainly                   not for Zero. He was fighting for Big Boss. He idolized him.",
"Big Mama         : When Ocelot grafted Liquid's right arm to his own... His                   body was taken over by Liquid's thoughts and spirit. He may                   be Ocelot in physical form, but his mind is Liquid's. I was                   the last one. And then, someone appeared to help me.",
"Snake            : Raiden....",
"Big Mama         : It was when I met him that I finally discovered the location                   of Big Boss. It was in the data he obtained from GW.                   Together, he and I retrieved Big Boss. But Big Boss was                   still asleep, as Zero had left him.",
"Snake            : Why did Zero keep him alive?",
"Big Mama         : People need heroes. Zero wanted to create a messiah... A                   legend... That would never die.",
"Snake            : Liquid is after Big Boss's body. Is it here?",
"Big Mama         : I'll take you to meet him.",
"Big Mama         : This is his pyx. His Holy Ark.",
"Big Mama         : His body is alive, but his consciousness is locked away by                   nanomachines. So technically speaking, he's not really brain                   dead. We can't allow Liquid to inherit the same sins that                   corrupted Zero... Manipulating people's minds for the sake                   of his own ego.",
"Snake            : Otacon...",
"Otacon           : Snake, it's Naomi...!",
"Snake            : What happpened?",
"Otacon           : She's gone. She's not in the Nomad anymore.",
"Snake            : When?",
"Otacon           : Less than an hour ago. She disappeared right after she and                   Sunny got back from Dr. Madnar's place.",
"Snake            : Why weren't you watching her?",
"Otacon           : I didn't have my glasses on.",
"Snake            : Naomi said it herself - the experiment can't succeed without                   her.",
"Otacon           : You think she went back to Liquid.",
"Snake            : What about Raiden?",
"Otacon           : Good news on that front. We managed to get our hands on a                   dialysis machine and set up an ICU. We just started him on                   dialysis and treatment for his wounds.",
"Snake            : Will he live?",
"Otacon           : Yeah, no worries there. Sunny's taken over for Naomi. But                   his treatment's probably going to take 48 hours. Until then,                   Raiden can't move.",
"Resistance 1     : Hey you! Come here!",
"Snake            : What the hell is that?",

"Big Mama         : Are they ready?",
"Resistance       : Yes, ma'am.",
"Big Mama         : We'll escape through the canal route using the real van. Get                   it ready. Hurry!",
"Resistance       : Yes, ma'am.",
"Big Mama         : Snake, over here. We've got decoy vans set to draw some of                   our pursuers away.",
"Big Mama         : All of these children were orphans. They work in arms                   factories, and when they grow up, they want to join a PMC.                   They seek revenge on other companies... PMCs that killed                   their parents and use their earnings to support their                   younger siblings. There are countless child soldiers like                   these in the PMCs. Nowadays, anyone with a computer can get                   combat training. The FPS games these children love are                   distributed for free by these companies. Of course, it's all                   just virtual training. It's so easy for them to get absorbed                   by these war games. And before they know it, they're in the                   PMCs holding real guns. These kids end up fighting in proxy                   wars that have nothing to do with their own lives. They                   think it's cool to fight like this. They think that combat                   is life. They don't need a reason to fight. After all, for                   them it's only a game.",
"Big Mama         : Zero is the cause of all this. Defeating Liquid won't change                   things. Unless we stop the Patriots' System, the cycle will                   go unbroken.",
"Big Mama         : Hop on. Hold on to me.",
"Big Mama         : With so many wars being waged, oil and biofuel have become                   as precious as diamonds. It's been a while since I went out                   for a ride.",

"Snake            : What's the catch?",
"Drebin           : Only that you give it to me when you're done with it. A                   weapon with that many decades of rage stored up inside it -                   now that's a collector's item.",
"Snake            : How old was she?",
"Drebin           : I'd say about 20. But she had years of soldiers' rage hidden                   away in that youthful body of hers.",
"Snake            : Soldiers?",
"Drebin           : Yeah. The soldiers of Aceh, a place that hasn't seen peace                   in a long, long time. She was captured by one side or                   another, and kept caged up like an animal along with God                   knows how many other kids.",
"Snake            : Anonymous violence.",
"Drebin           : Exactly. It's unknown whether her captors were with the                   government or the rebels. In any case, they got their kicks                   by abusing these helpless little kids day after day after                   day. That constant barrage, that battlefield rage, slowly                   built up inside their bodies... Their minds. The kids tried                   to keep each others' spirits up, always clinging to the hope                   that someone would come to their rescue, barely surviving                   off scraps of food. But those soldiers didn't stop. They                   called the kids parasites and shit-eating ravens. Beat 'em                   even harder. Then one morning, the soldiers just up and                   left, leaving the surviving kids to be eaten alive by the                   birds. Almost like one of those sky burials. One by one,                   their bodies were picked apart by ravens' beaks, until                   finally the flock came for her. But by some miracle, their                   beaks cut her bonds instead. And like that, she was                   liberated. In that instant, she was filled with an                   uncontrollable rage, and it smothered her soul. She ripped                   the ravens pecking at her to pieces and then went after the                   soldiers. And when she finally caught up with them, she                   waited until nightfall like a hunter awaiting its prey. They                    say that when a raven cries, a man dies. And that's exactly                   what happened that night. Screeching and cawing, she killed                   every last living being in the camp, both the soldiers and                   the civilians they'd enslaved. In her eyes, there was no                   longer a difference. The cruelty her friends had suffered,                   the pain and humiliation she'd endured... Hers was the                   distillation of the rage that decades of war had imparted on                   those soldiers.",
"Snake            : It was her strength - and her greatest weakness.",
"Drebin           : You're something else, Snake. You managed to cleanse Raven                   of her rage. No, seriously. You're the seed of war. In fact,                   I'd say you might even be war itself.",
"Snake            : Drebin...",
"Drebin           : Maybe it's still too early to tell. You've still got half                   the BB Corpsahead of you. Keep your eye on the ball, pal.",
"Big Mama         : Snake... I have to apologize. The three vans that came out                   with us were decoys. The real one is floating down the                   river, headed downstream.",
"Big Mama         : I managed to get in touch with the children... The pyx is                   safe. We're going to rendezvous on the riverbank downstream.                   Land and air routes are cut off...",
"Big Mama         : But there's a cruiser waiting for us. The Volta River is our                   only chance of escape. Let's get out of here... Hurry...",

This man's body has served me                   well... Allowing me to pass every security barrier between                   me and GW. After all, the Patriots' System is nothing more                   than a machine. Now that GW is a spook inside the network,                   there's no way JD would recognize it as an external threat.                   Once I destroy JD with a nuclear strike, the Patriots'                   network will be mine. And then, I'll build my Haven... Free                   from all forms of control. I'll cast aside my old                   identity... And take my own name for the first time.",

"Big Mama         : You and the beasts are no different... Scorched shadows born                   to the world. When a beast steps into the light... Unless                   the light is put out... The shadows cannot be erased. So                   long as there is light... There is shadow. To return                   everything to normal... The light must be extinguished.",
"Big Mama         : And when that happens... You... Will be... Too.",
"Snake            : You.",
"Drebin           : Like I said, we pride ourselves on service.",
"Drebin           : Come on. Let's take this guy to his friends.",
"Sunny            : Kawanishi-Noseguchi... Kinunobebashi, Takiyama...                   Uguisunomori, Tsuzumigataki, Tada, Hirano. Ichinotorii,                   Uneno... Yamashita, Sasabe... Kofudai, Tokiwadai,                   Myokenguchi...",
"Liquid Ocelot    : We'll launch a stealth nuclear warhead at JD.",
"Naomi            : I thought you couldn't control a nuke with GW.",
"Liquid Ocelot    : We can't. We've taken over their guns and heavy weapons, but                   the WMDs are still under JD's control. That's where REX                   comes in. I know where to find nukes they don't control.                   Vamp, how long until REX is ready?",
"Vamp             : All that's left is the final check. We've identified JD's                   location through GW. An abandoned 20th century satellite                   orbit, disguised as debris.",
"Naomi            : A clever place to hide.",
"Liquid Ocelot    : Satellite orbit....",
"Vamp             : With a stealth nuke, there's no need to worry about the                   Patriots intercepting it. By the time they realize what's                   happening, it'll all be over.",
"Liquid Ocelot    : Once JD - the core AI - is destroyed... GW's priority will                   rise to 1. And all the systems under JD's control will then                   be ours to command. Now go. Prepare our Haven.",
"Vamp             : Yes, Boss.",
"Vamp             : What the devil is this...?!",
"Otacon           : The video feed from the Mk.II cuts off here.",
"Snake            : Haven... Yeah... Drebin was saying something about that.",
"Otacon           : In the beginning, the Patriots' System was controlled by                   four AIs, with JD at the top. One of those AIs was GW. The                   Patriots thought it had been destroyed. But Liquid was able                   to use it as cover to slip inside the System.",
"Snake            : GW... I knew I'd heard that name before.",
"Otacon           : Yeah, GW was one of the Patriots' cell AIs. It was installed                   on Arsenal Gear. Emma's worm should have put it permanently                   out of commission. But Liquid somehow recovered and repaired                   it. I'm guessing JD must be unable to recognize GW even                   though it's inside the Patriots' System. It's a blind spot.                   GW was written off as lost while it was still tied in. Using                   it let Liquid interfere with the AI from the inside. He made                   contact under the guise of Big Boss's genetic code. Even the                   AI threat detection system was fooled.",
"Snake            : A haven on the network... Free from oversight by the                   Patriots' AIs.",
"Otacon           : It all makes sense now. That's why they made Arsenal go                   berserk five years ago. GW was on board.",
"Snake            : Where is this haven? Where is their base?",
"Otacon           : Don't worry. Mei Ling is using the position of the Mk.II's                   last transmission to predict the course of Liquid's ship.                   It's only a matter of time before we find him.",
"Snake            : But that's not all Liquid said... Something about REX being                   ready.",
"Otacon           : REX? You mean... Shadow Moses.",
"Otacon           : It's Campbell.",
"Campbell         : The US military's systems are all in Liquid's hands now. The                   regional systems have all been shut down. Guns are falling                   silent across the earth. It's the first total cease-fire in                   human history.",
"Otacon           : How's the White House responding? The public...?",
"Campbell         : The President has yet to make an official announcement. But                   the media is starting to pick up on it.",
"Snake            : The information's gonna be controlled anyway.",
"Campbell         : Not this time. The war economy has ground to a complete                   halt. It's tough to play down a crisis of these proportions.                   War economy-related stocks are already going into a free                   fall.",
"Snake            : They must be shitting themselves at the White House right                   about now.",
"Campbell         : In any case, America had better sleep soundly while she                   still can. Liquid's insurrection... Is about to begin. The                   first thing he'll do is try to destroy the System the                   Patriots built to control the US.",
"Otacon           : He's already taken the System.",
"Campbell         : No. Supreme authority still resides with JD which the                   Patriots still command. Which is why Liquid plans to launch                   a nuclear strike on JD in its orbit.",
"Snake            : But Liquid only controls SOP, the SOP only controls guns and                   small firearms. Unless he gains supreme authority, Liquid                   can't use America's nukes and ballistic missiles... So how's                   he gonna launch this strike?",
"Campbell         : Good question. The US converted its nuclear arsenal to                   reliable replacement warheads two years ago.",
"Otacon           : RRWs.",
"Campbell         : Yes. The core of the RRWs is now completely ID controlled by                   the SOP System. You'd need supreme authority from JD itself                   to control them. And they can be shut down remotely in case                   of an emergency.",
"Otacon           : All the old nukes were pulled out of service when they                   deployed the replacements.",
"Snake            : If Liquid can't use the nukes... Then what's his plan?",
"Otacon           : That's it! He's going to use REX!",
"Snake            : What?",
"Otacon           : REX was scrapped before the Sons of the Patriots System was                   implemented.",
"Snake            : Of course... The rail gun.",
"Campbell         : Indeed. REX's rail gun can launch a stealth nuclear warhead                   into space unconstrained by the System. In short, it's the                   only device they have that is able to launch a nuke.                   Liquid's going to use it to kill JD and deliver the coup de                   grace to the Patriots reign.",
"Otacon           : Campbell, where's REX now?",
"Campbell         : I think you know. A long-forgotten base, in US territory,                   outside the Patriots' control... The place where Liquid made                   his debut... His monument. Off the Alaskan coast, in the Fox                   Archipelago...",
"Snake            : Shadow Moses Island.",
"Campbell         : If Liquid destroys JD, and his GW assumes total control over                   the System... He'll have the world at his fingertips. And no                   one will be able to stop him. Not even the Patriots. You are                   the only ones who can save us now. Snake, I'm counting on                   you. Defeat Liquid and put an end to his insurrection.",
"Otacon           : Enough is enough, Snake. You can't take any more of this.",
"Snake            : I'm not dead yet.",
"Otacon           : That's not what I mean. You can't beat Liquid. He's got the                   Patriots' own control system on his side. Not only are                   weapons useless, but the US military is in shambles. And                   even if it weren't, Liquid's got enough men and machines to                   match it.",
"Otacon           : Things can't get any worse.",
"Otacon           : Face it, Snake... We've lost.",
"Snake            : Otacon...!",
"Otacon           : We never stood a chance.",
"Snake            : It's not about winning or losing. I... No, we started this.                   And it's our duty to finish it.",
"Snake            : Sunny...",
"Sunny            : No! Jack can't go. He's not ready yet. He needs to rest!",
"Raiden           : Let me go, Sunny.",
"Sunny            : No... Your dialysis isn't done yet.",
"Otacon           : Snake... He's not ready yet.",
"Raiden           : Snake...",
"Raiden           : I'll be fine.",
"Raiden           : From now on... I'm living my life by my own will.",
"Snake            : Raiden....",
"Raiden           : I won't live a proxy life... A slave to someone else's will.",
"Snake            : I'm a shadow. One that no light will shine on. As long as                   you follow me, you'll never see the day.",
"Raiden           : You and I are both just pawns in this proxy war. But once                   this is over, we will have our freedom.",
"Snake            : Raiden....",
"Raiden           : I'll release you. It's the only way I'll ever be free.",
"Snake            : Raiden... Five years ago... That's not what I meant.",
"Raiden           : I've got nothing to lose.",
"Snake            : Don't be an idiot. You know you've got someone to protect.",
"Raiden           : It was never going to work out for me. It even 'rained' the                   day I was born.",
"Snake            : You've got it all wrong. You were the lightning in that                   rain. You can still shine through the darkness.",
"Raiden           : The lightning....",
"Snake            : Raiden... Look at me.",
"Snake            : Do you see this?",
"Snake            : I have no future. In a few months, I'm going to be a weapon                   of mass destruction. You... You have a family.",
"Raiden           : I have no family! I have nothing!",
"Raiden           : I have always been alone. Always.",
"Snake            : Raiden....",
"Raiden           : Don't leave me here alone.",
"Snake            : This is my fight. My destiny.",
"Otacon           : Mei Ling.",
"Mei Ling         : I got the results back. It's official. He's on Shadow Moses                   Island. We lost Metal Gear Mk.II's signal along the way, but                   the ship was headed in the direction of Shadow Moses.",
"Mei Ling         : This is a picture of the island taken by a civilian imagery                   satellite.",
"Mei Ling         : The sea line is rising due to global warming. Have you heard                   that the enire Fox Archipelago is about to slip into the                   ocean? The surrounding islands have already been evacuated.",
"Snake            : Liquid's arrival there can only mean one thing...",
"Otacon           : He is going to use REX.",
"Mei Ling         : That's how it looks from here. All the Metal Gears after REX                   were embedded with System IDs.",
"Otacon           : Then what about REX? What did Washington do with it?",
"Mei Ling         : The nuclear disposal facility on Shadow Moses hasn't been                   touched since the incident.",
"Otacon           : That was nine years ago.",
"Mei Ling         : The president of ArmsTech and the DARPA chief were killed,                   and the Secretary of Defense was arrested... By the time the                   Shadow Moses Incident was over... There wasn't a single                   person left there who knew what took place.",
"Mei Ling         : It was as if nothing had ever happened. The data was either                   falsified or erased so no traces would be left behind. We                   were exiled to desk jobs for the same reason. REX and the                   nukes should still be where they were nine years ago                   untouched.",
"Otacon           : A forsaken island. A haven.",
"Mei Ling         : I'd say it's more like a forgotten island.",
"Mei Ling         : And it's sinking, too.",
"Otacon           : Thought I'd never go back.",
"Mei Ling         : It'll take me a while to get there, but I'll be backing you                   up from aboard the Missouri. She's the only ship in the                   fleet still able to move... Since it was decomissioned                   before the System was put in place. And Hawai'i is not that                   far away. Otacon, you're not wearing your glasses anymore?",
"Otacon           : I switched to contacts.",
"Mei Ling         : We rendezvous at Shadow Moses.",
"Mei Ling         : He who submits to heaven shall live... He who defies heaven                   shall perish.",
"Otacon           : I have to atone for my past, too. REX is a beast born from                   my research. Let's go. Shadow Moses awaits.",
"Otacon           : Everything all right, Snake?",
"Snake            : I was having that dream again.",
"Otacon           : We're here. Shadow Moses.",
"Otacon           : Snake! Are you all right?",
"Snake            : Yeah. I just slipped a little. Have to hurry... Not much                   time left.",
"Otacon           : Meet the Mk.III. It's our last replacement, so try not to                   break it.",
"Snake            : Who, me? Never.",
"Otacon           : One more thing... I don't see anybody around, but there are                   unmanned sentries patrolling the area. Be careful out there.",
"Otacon           : The heliport is to the west of there. Head west and find                   that heliport.",
"Otacon           : It looks like the front hangar door is open a little bit, at                   least. You can get in that way if you want.",
"Snake            : A surveillance camera?",
"Otacon           : I don't see any enemies around here. OK, we'll go through                   the door all the way at the back.",
"Snake            : Otacon, last time around we had a few complications and                   wound up going through the commander's office in the                   basement.",
"Otacon           : That's right... I remember now. But there's no need to go                   all the way down there this time, right? The back door takes                   us straight where we need to go.",
"Snake            : Good point.",
"Otacon           : OK, then. Let's get to the back door.",
"Otacon           : Snake, that door is locked.",
"Snake            : How do I open it?",
"Otacon           : Security is shut down altogether. You can't release the lock                   without activating it. You'll have to go log in somewhere.                   I've got it, Snake. My old office is close by. With the                   power on, you should be able to unlock the door from there.                   And if you check the facility records, we can find out REX's                   status and who's been in and out. You remember where it is,                   Snake?",
"Snake            : I'm not senile yet.",
"Otacon           : Just to be safe, I'm marking it on your map. You old geezer.",
"Otacon           : Snake, the password is 48273. Think you can remember that?",
"Snake            : I told you, I'm not senile... Yet.",
"Otacon           : Snake, I've checked the APU on this floor and engaged the                   generator. Energy output is low, but it should be enough to                   power the elevator. Try the elevator and see if it's                   working.",
"Otacon           : OK, first go down the central hallway. Don't worry, it's not                   electrified any more.",
"Otacon           : Everything looks exactly like I remember it. Except for that                   wall way in back, anyway. I still can't believe how much                   damage you caused in such a small space.",
"Snake            : The switchboard - nailed it with a remote-control missile to                   shut down the electric current in the floor. The guidance                   system in those things takes up so much space it hardly                   leaves any room for explosives.",
"Otacon           : Didn't make much of a bang, huh?",
"Snake            : Hardly. Switchboard's still intact.",
"Otacon           : You're right. The wiring past the switch circuits could                   still be live.",
"Snake            : Wait a minute... I'm not going to get shocked if I walk on                   this floor, am I?",
"Otacon           : No need to worry. As long as you don't turn the current back                   on.",
"Otacon           : Hold on. I want to check security.",
"Otacon           : Are you all right? Snake, are you OK?",
"Otacon           : Snake, that password I told you before... You remember it,                   right? 'Cause I completely forgot.",
"Otacon           : Can you punch it in for me? It's a five-digit number....",
"Otacon           : Nice job. At least your memory hasn't gone bad.",
"Otacon           : This version is totally obsolete. It's going to take a                   little work.",
"Otacon           : This is the room where we first met, huh?",
"Snake            : Yep.",
"Otacon           : It's not conjuring up any unpleasant memories, is it?",
"Otacon           : I was being attacked by Frank Jaeger.",
"Snake            : Yeah... I remember.",
"Otacon           : If you hadn't shown up when you did... It gives me the                   shivers just thinking about it. Snake, you saved my life.",
"Snake            : Naomi hated them for what they did to Frank's body... But it                   was me that crippled him in the first place. She must have                   hated me, too.",
"Otacon           : We shouldn't have been so trusting. I blame myself, too. I                   helped develop REX. That's why it was so easy for me to                   believe her feelings were genuine. But she was only using us                   to atone for her sins.",
"Snake            : So what? What did she do to us?",
"Otacon           : You forgot already? She betrayed you! She stole your blood!",
"Snake            : No. If that was all, it should have been over and done with                   in South America. Why'd she join us afterward?",
"Otacon           : Well, I....",
"Snake            : She has us come rescue her and then she turns around goes                   straight back to Liquid. Why would she do that?",
"Otacon           : I don't know, Snake. But it looks like she's still with him.",
"Snake            : What?",
"Otacon           : I just had a look at the security access logs... As I                   thought, there's people coming and going at frequent                   intervals. In fact, the records show some recent activity.                   Look at this.",
"Otacon           : It's an image taken a few hours ago by a surveillance camera                   up ahead.",
"Snake            : Naomi.",
"Otacon           : And Vamp.",
"Snake            : The beauty and the beast.",
"Otacon           : They've been through here. And from what we've gleaned from                   the security records, it can only mean one thing... They're                   headed for REX's old underground hangar.",
"Otacon           : I finished rebooting security and released the locks. The                   door on the first floor ought to open for you now.",
"Snake            : Amazing. Almost makes me nostalgic for the days when you                   needed a keycard for every door.",
"Otacon           : Yep. It's been nine years. All you really have to do is                   reinterpret the old technology in terms of the new. Getting                   old isn't all that bad, you know. Let's get going, Snake.",
"Otacon           : I finished unlocking the door on the first floor. It should                   open now.",
"Otacon           : Gekko! We've got Gekko!",
"Otacon           : Snake, it's blocking the hallway leading to the elevator.                   You'll have to do something before you can get to the first                   floor.",
"Otacon           : OK! Nice, Snake!",
"Otacon           : OK, Snake. Take the stairs down and go to the north door.                   I'll open it for you with the Mk.III.",
"Otacon           : Oh, man! More Gekko! The Mk.III is totally defenseless while",
"Otacon           : Ok, Snake! It's open now.",
"Crying Wolf      : Snake... Found you.",
"Crying Wolf      : Cry... Cry for me.",
"Crying Wolf      : Go on... Let me hear you cry!",
"Crying Wolf      : Come... Show me your tears. Let them flow! Cry... Until your                   eyes run red!",
"Crying Wolf      : Sad... So sad... So very, very sad...",
"Crying Wolf      : So sad I could die!",
"Crying Beauty    : I hear them... I hear the cries... The cries of babies.",
"Crying Beauty    : Stop it! Stop crying! Please! Please, stop crying!",
"Crying Beauty    : No, wolf... Go away. Don't come any closer.",
"Crying Beauty    : I'm sorry. I was so scared. Forgive me. I'm sorry. You can                   cry if you want to. Cry if you need to.",
"Crying Beauty    : No... I don't need tears anymore.",
"Crying Beauty    : I've cried myself dry.",
"Crying Beauty    : So cry... As much as you like. I... Will be there to listen.",
"Drebin           : Yo, Snake. I finished laundering that rail gun you picked up                   just now. Knock yourself out. It's on the house.",
"Snake            : Thanks.",
"Drebin           : Time for another bedtime story, Snake. This one's about                   Crying Wolf. You don't need me to tell you there's whole                   nations in Africa tearing themselves apart in the name of                   ethnic cleansing. Well, she was born into that environment.                   When she was a little girl, her village was attacked by                   rival armed factions. Her parents and siblings were                   slaughtered, and she was left a refugee. She took her last                   surviving relative, her baby brother, and ran as far as she                   could away from the war zone. One day, they came across an                   enemy unit, so she took her brother and hid in an abandoned                   shack. And then her brother started to cry... She knew that                   if the soldiers heard the noise, they would find them and                   kill them both. So she wrapped her hands as tight as she                   could around his mouth. As the footsteps gradually went                   away, she came back to her senses. Her brother wasn't crying                   anymore. Horrified, she pulled her hand away, covered in                   sweat and spit. He wasn't breathing. They say wolves eat                   their own pups when they die. She was spotted wandering                   through the thick of battle carrying her dead brother in her                   arms. She had visions, too - a wolf walking alongside her.                   Every night, the wolf would howl and cry, just like her                   brother did that day. Eventually, she made it to a                   government-run refugee camp. But by then, her brother's body                   had rotted away. The camp was crowded with refugees like                   herself, and little children like her brother. Day and night                   she was tormented by the cries of babies. The wolf that                   followed her heard her sorrowful screams and answered. He                   made his way around the camp. And one by one... He silenced                   the children. She tried to stop it, but she was powerless to                   stop the wolf. A few days passed, and on the eve of the                   enemy's raid, there wasn't a child left. The adults who                   survived were torn up pretty bad. Of course, there never was                   any wolf in that camp. She was the one who killed those                   babies. But she couldn't bring herself to admit it. She                   couldn't bear the thought of herself going from one baby to                   the next, howling like a wolf, snuffing out their little                   lives. And she never did, even as Crying Wolf, a lonely                   beast forever stalking the battlefield. Snake, fighting with                   you made Wolf finally accept what she'd done. She was                   cleansed by you. It the cries she heard of children on the                   battlefield have been silenced, it's because of you. You                   ought to be proud. Three down, one to go. All that's left is                   Mantis. But you should know, Snake - she's been controlling                   all the other Beasts. She's the Beast of Beasts. Don't let                   her get her hooks in you.",
"Snake            : I won't.",
"Drebin           : See you around, Snake.",
"Otacon           : Welcome home... Wolf.",
"Otacon           : Hold it, Snake. Time to change the disc. I know, I know...                   It's a pain. But you need to swap Disc 1 for Disc 2. You see                   the disc labeled '2'?",
"Snake            : No.",
"Otacon           : Huh? Oh, wait! We're on PS3 system! It's a Blu-ray Disc.                   Dual-layered, too - no need to swap.",
"Snake            : Damn it, Otacon, get a grip!",
"Otacon           : Yeah, what an age we live in, huh, Snake? Wonder what                   they'll think of next!",
"Snake            : Otacon, how do I get this door open?",
"Otacon           : It's not opening? That's weird... I know I disengaged                   security back at the lab...",
"Snake            : We should have been able to get to REX's storage hangar from                   here.",
"Otacon           : I've got it. If memory serves, there are casting and rolling                   facilities directly beneath the furnace. You should be able                   to pass through them to a drainage duct that leads to the                   hangar.",
"Snake            : How do I get there?",
"Otacon           : There should be a special service elevator in the northwest                   corner of this floor.",
"Snake            : Northwest corner - got it.",
"McDonell Miller  : Snake. I've got something to tell you about Naomi Hunter.",
"Snake            : What about her?",
"McDonell Miller  : She might be a spy!",
"Snake            : To kill me? Is that all you cared about?",
"Naomi            : Frank Jaeger, the man who you destroyed, was my brother and                   my only family.",
"Snake            : Gray Fox?",
"Naomi            : You killed my benefactor and sent my brother home a cripple.                   I vowed revenge.",
"Snake            : But I can't go yet. I still have a job to do.",
"Naomi            : I vowed revenge...",
"Otacon           : Finally, it's just up ahead. The hangar is just a little bit                   further. Stay en route.",
"Otacon           : REX is on the floor above you. Use the lift.",
"Otacon           : Hop on, Snake. I'll send 'er up.",
"Otacon           : REX!",
"Otacon           : Look! The rail gun's been removed! Liquid doesn't need the                   whole REX to launch his nuke... He only needs the rail gun.",
"Snake            : Damn it! Has it already been shipped?",
"Otacon           : Hang on, I'll check.",
"Vamp             : Unfortunately for you... The rail gun is no longer here.",
"Snake            : Naomi!",
"Vamp             : This place will be your grave... As my Queen wishes. The                   Suicide Gekko are on their way. Soon, there'll be nothing                   left of this place.",
"Snake            : We've been had... Otacon!",
"Otacon           : Snake, I think I might be able to get it working. I just                   need some time!",
"Snake            : Hurry!",
"Naomi            : I'll leave the rest to you.",

"Vamp             : Excellent... You'll amuse me until they arrive.",
"Vamp             : Come on, kill me....",
"Otacon           : I'll take care of REX. You take Vamp! Kill that monster! Get                   Naomi back, Snake! Please!",
"Vamp             : What have you done?",
"Snake            : There... Now you're a mere mortal - like the rest of us.",
"Vamp             : Clever... But can you kill this mere mortal?",
"Snake            : Gekko!",
"Otacon           : Snake! Look out! They're rigged to self-destruct!",
"Raiden           : Snake... Sorry to have kept you all waiting.",
"Snake            : You ready for this?",
"Raiden           : Sunny gave me the go-ahead.",
"Vamp             : How about it, undying man? Care to die, too?",
"Raiden           : Sorry... But I can't die just yet.",
"Vamp             : Then kill me.",
"Raiden           : Snake... This one is mine. You keep those Gekko at bay.",
"Snake            : Otacon, we're gonna buy you some time.",
"Otacon           : I'll do my best!",
"Vamp             : Wait... You're a scout, too, are you not? Then let us duel                   with blades.",
"Otacon           : Those are Suicide Gekko. They blow up, and they take us with                   them. You've got to keep them back! I'm sending you data on                   where to aim. Put a bullet through their brains!",
"Otacon           : Snake, get out of the way!",
"Snake            : REX!",
"Otacon           : This thing might come in handy after all.",
"Naomi            : He was never immortal. His natural healing abilities were                   enhanced by the nanomachines inside his body. But after so                   many battles... He's finally reached his limit.",
"Vamp             : Doctor... Ease my pain.",
"Raiden           : Naomi... Sunny asked me to tell you something.",

"Raiden           : I cooked them right.",
"Naomi            : I see. Good for you, Sunny. You finally did it.",
"Naomi            : No. I can't save you. You have to trust me, Dr. Emmerich.                   Give this to him. Not for revenge, but to end his suffering.",
"Naomi            : Now you can return to your true self. You can be at peace.",

"Naomi            : Yes.",
"Naomi            : Forgive me.",
"Otacon           : This doesn't change anything. Why?",
"Naomi            : We can't... Erase the past. Nor... Can we forgive it. And so                   the only thing we can do... Is end it.",
"Naomi            : Snake... Liquid's down below us. He's stolen the Patriots'                   System... Slipped out of their sight, and taken their ark.",

"Naomi            : A warship... Unfettered by land... Law... Country... Or                   network. The only place where they are truly released from                   the shackles of the Patriots... The place where they can be                   free. Outer Haven.",

When all of this is over, you'll have no choice but to                   accept death. We are given life only so that we can atone                   for our sins. Your life was created for that very purpose.                   We all must atone for our own sins. We must not pass them on                   to the next generation. We must not leave them for the                   future. That is your true fate... One that even you cannot                   defy.",

"Naomi            : Cancer. I shouldn't even be alive right now. The                   nanomachines have kept it from progressing... But there's                   nothing more they can do. With the nanomachines gone... Time                   will unfreeze and begin to flow again.",

"Rosemary         : We started arguing, and I forgot all about the tourists.",
"Jack             : The next thing we knew, the tourists had gone away. And a                   week later, I found you again by coincidence out in the base                   corridor.",
"Rosemary         : An amazing coincidence....",
"Jack             : That night, we went up to the top of the Empire State                   Building.",
"Rosemary         : It was so beautiful.",
"Jack             : I didn't care anymore who was right.",
"Rosemary         : And that was our first date.",
"Jack             : We watched King Kong in your apartment a bunch of times that                   night... Didn't sleep till morning.",
"Mei Ling         : Fire!",
"Mei Ling         : Fire!",
"Liquid Ocelot    : Worthless fossil!",
"Snake            : Raiden... Raiden...",
"Mei Ling         : Haven is headed southward through the Pacific at a speed of                   33 knots.",
"Mei Ling         : The Missouri is falling behind at a rate of about two                   nautical miles every hour.",
"Otacon           : Can't this thing go any faster?",
"Mei Ling         : I'm afraid not. This is as fast as she'll go. Liquid's                   target is JD, a US military satellite disguised as orbital                   debris.",
"Mei Ling         : Haven will have to surface in order to use the rail gun.",
"Akiba            : If we can figure out JD's orbit...",
"Akiba            : We should be able to predict where Haven's gonna surface.",
"Mei Ling         : JD is in a synchronous elliptical orbit... So its next                   perigee should be in....",
"Akiba            : Got it! 15 hours, 6 minutes, and 12 seconds.",
"Mei Ling         : Right.",
"Mei Ling         : In 15 hours, it's going to be over the Bering Sea... 494                   nautical miles from the Bering Strait. Haven knows it, too.                   They'll be holding position in that area.",
"Meryl            : Do they really have to get that close to launch?",
"Otacon           : The nukes fired by REX's rail gun have a damage radius of                   approximately 300 meters. The target is a moving satellite                   that's travelling at 10 kilometers per second. To get the                   precision they need, they have to get as close as they                   possibly can.",
"Mei Ling         : Liquid won't launch his nuke until JD is at perigee. The                   Missouri can use that time to catch up.",
"Meryl            : Will we make it?",
"Mei Ling         : Once Haven stops moving, it'll take us an hour to close the                   gap.",
"Mei Ling         : After that, the Missouri needs to strike before Haven's                   launch preparations are complete. This ship was stripped of                   most of its equipment... And she's got no electronic warfare                   capabilities of any kind. No radar, no high-tech weaponry.                   We'll have to rely on our own eyes to track the enemy.",
"Mei Ling         : From the looks of it, Haven is going to use a rail gun                   mounted on the bridge to destroy JD. They'll need to open                   the cover to launch the nuke. That's our one and only chance                   to get inside.",
"Meryl            : Inside? Why can't we attack it from here?",
"Otacon           : It wouldn't do any good. As long as Liquid has control of                   the System... Physically destroying GW would still leave                   supreme authority in his hands... Sons of the Patriots.",
"Mei Ling         : Yes. Dr. Emmerich is right. That's why we need to destroy GW                   from the inside before attacking Haven itself.",
"Snake            : Liquid's very own Death Star...",
"Mei Ling         : All right everybody, here's the plan... We know Haven will                   have to surface in order to fire the rail gun. When it does,                   the Missouri will see it. We'll make a quick approach and                   deliver a strike team.",
"Mei Ling         : Our goal is twofold... Prevent that nuke from launching, and                   wipe out GW's programming. The enemy relies entirely on                   electronic means of threat detection... So they won't be                   able to see the Missouri until they surface.",
"Meryl            : Akiba!",
"Mei Ling         : We'll launch the strike team from catapults at the exact                   moment Haven's armored cover opens. They'll then penetrate                   GW's physical server room and infect it with a worm cluster.",
"Akiba            : But what if they shut down GW before we get in there?",
"Mei Ling         : Liquid is already entrenched within the Patriots' network.                   He needs to stay there, or destroying JD won't serve him any                   purpose. They can't afford to have GW shut down.",
"Meryl            : And let's not forget... Liquid will throw everything he's                   got at stopping the strike team.",
"Mei Ling         : Exactly. The corridor leading to GW is defended by                   directed-energy weapons that emit certain types of                   microwaves.",
"Akiba            : Did you say...microwaves?",
"Mei Ling         : That's right. And at that frequency, the waves will start to                   evaporate any living person within range.",
"Snake            : A giant microwave oven. You'd have to have a death wish to                   go in there. Sounds like the perfect job for me.",
"Meryl            : Snake, this isn't the time for your stupid jokes.",
"Mei Ling         : Outside the corridor, Liquid's soldiers will be out in full                   force. Inside, there'll be unmanned weapons waiting for us.",
"Snake            : Where are you getting all this information? You really think                   there's a way to destroy GW?",
"Mei Ling         : Yes, I do. She...left us something that'll point us in the                   right direction.",
"Otacon           : Naomi helped with the preparations to stop Haven's launch.",
"Snake            : Naomi?",
"Otacon           : All of our internal data on Haven came from her. The reason                   she got on the Nomad with us in the first place... Was to                   get close to me. But she ended up turning to Sunny instead.",
"Snake            : What do you mean?",
"Otacon           : She left her plan in Sunny's hands.",
"Mei Ling         : This entire operation is based on the data she left us.",
"Snake            : Whose side was she on, anyway?",
"Otacon           : We'll never know exactly what her true intentions were...                   But one thing's for sure: She was determined to stop Liquid.",
"Naomi            : Promise... Promise me... You'll carry on... Our will...",
"Meryl            : Come on guys - somebody say something positive. Anything.",
"Mei Ling         : Attention! Listen up! A wise man once wrote... The tongues                   of dying men enforce attention, like deep harmony. Where                   words are spent, they are seldom spent in vain.",
"Mei Ling         : Any other questions?",
"Mei Ling         : Yes? Snake?",
"Snake            : Anybody got a smoke?",
"Meryl            : Snake....",
"Snake            : So this program... You're saying Sunny wrote it?",
"Otacon           : Actually, only about a third of it is her work. Naomi was                   working on a program to destroy GW, but she couldn't quite                   finish it. So she handed it over to Sunny.",
"Otacon           : Sunny went fishing in my library to see if there was any                   source code she could use to complete it. Eventually, she                   found some... It was Emma's worm cluster.",
"Otacon           : She took my sister's code and worked it into Naomi's                   program. I didn't have time to look over every single line                   of code... But what I did see... Reminded me of Emma. It was                   like she left traces of herself behind in the structure. But                   this worm cluster that Sunny created... It's even better                   than Emma's.",
"Otacon           : Sunny's worm destroys the AI's intellect by triggering                   apoptosis in the cells. Once uploaded into GW, it should do                   some real damage.",
"Otacon           : Snake... You ever think about quiting?",
"Snake            : Why? It's not like I've got my health to worry about.",
"Otacon           : Are you trying to kill yourself? So, you're dead set on                   going to Haven yourself.... Why don't we get somebody else                   to go? There's no need for you to do it.",
"Snake            : I still have things left to do... Besides smoke.",
"Snake            : Otacon. Why don't you jump off the ship with me?",
"Otacon           : I don't think so. I've still got things to do myself. And I                   don't even smoke.",
"Navy Man 1       : Captain, enemy vessel at 300 meters and still rising.",
"Mei Ling         : And the engines?",
"Navy Man 2       : No problems to report.",
"Mei Ling         : Prepare to go for full speed ahead. And get the strike team                   ready for immediate launch.",
"Navy Man 1       : Aye aye, captain.",
"Mei Ling         : How long until it surfaces?",
"Navy Man 2       : About 20 minutes.",
"Mei Ling         : Right on schedule. When she surfaces and opens up her armor,                   we'll move in as planned.",
"Navy Man 2       : Aye, captain.",
"Navy Man 2       : Captain?",
"Mei Ling         : Yes?",
"Navy Man 2       : This is my first real engagement.",
"Mei Ling         : I see. Your point?",
"Navy Man 2       : At first, getting assigned to this ship was a big letdown                   for me. But the inaction was kind of a relief, too.                   Captain... I'm scared.",
"Mei Ling         : It's OK. I'm scared, too. This is also my first time. But                   I'm not going to let it get to me, because I'm more scared                   of what'll happen if I run away.",
"Mei Ling         : Nobody is going to die on my watch. This ship is going back                   to Hawai'i in one piece. That, I promise.",
"Navy Man 2       : Right. Thank you.",
"Snake            : Raiden... How is he?",
"Otacon           : He'll live, but he's in no shape to fight. Best to let him                   rest.",
"Snake            : Right.",
"Otacon           : Without the System to protect them, everybody's losing their                   nerve. They say SOP's aftereffects are so bad that a lot of                   soldiers are deserting.",
"Snake            : The only people I have left to rely on are Meryl and... Him.",
"Otacon           : Kind of an unknown quantity, isn't he?",
"Drebin           : Fancy meetin' you here.",
"Snake            : What are you doing here?",
"Drebin           : I laundered these guys' IDs, then issued 'em new, naked                   weapons... Including that catapult you're gonna be riding.                   Buisness has been slow ever since Liquid got his hands on                   the System... His extra orders stopped coming in.",
"Drebin           : Now that all the weapons all over the world are locked, the                   only ones still lookin' to fight would be you n' yours. They                   tell me it's not economical to replace all that useless                   equipment on the battlefield with my stuff. So I made an                   extra special trip out here... Just for you.",
"Snake            : Drebin, do you have even the slightest idea what's going on                   here?",
"Drebin           : 'Course I do.",
"Drebin           : See, when it comes down to it, the world's like this soda                   here. Once the bubbles are gone, I ain't got no use for it.                   It's worth nothing. I'm on the side of whoever needs me the                   most. You dig?",
"Drebin           : If you need anything, just say the word. I'm settin' up shop                   here for a spell.",
"Drebin           : Enjoy it... Could be your last.",
"Snake            : It is. I'm all out.",
"Snake            : All right.",
"Drebin           : Looks like that last smoke will have to wait after all.                   Later.",
"Snake            : Hey... Here.",
"Soldier          : Oh, thanks.",
"Meryl            : You're over there.",
"Meryl            : There!",
"Campbell         : Snake, can you hear me? Liquid's warship - Outer Haven - is                   a modified version of an Arsenal Gear model stolen from the                   Patriots. Inside it's crawling with IRVING and other                   unmanned weapons. According to Naomi's data, Haven is crewed                   by a battalion of enhanced soldiers... Each culled from the                   best the PMCs have to offer.",
"Campbell         : If Liquid succeeds in destroying JD and gaining control of                   the Patriots' System... He'll make Haven his flagship, and                   his PMCs will spread like wildfire across the globe.",

Sounds like something the devil's cooked up, if you ask me.                   Mantis came from South America. She was born and raised in a                   country wracked by never-ending civil wars. Her village was                   attacked by enemy forces and burned to the ground. This was                   when she was still a little girl. Hunted by enemy death                   squads, she was separated from her family. She barely                   managed to escape with her life... Ended up in the basement                   of this one building. It was full of corpses that had been                   dumped there. Almost all of them had been tortured to death.                   She was petrified with fear. And then she heard the sound of                   heavy boots on the floor above her, followed by shrieking                   screams, the kind that would make every hair on your body                   stand straight up. She had stumbled across a makeshift                   torture chamber. Somebody had locked the door, and she was                   trapped. It was dark. It was dank. And it was full of a                   wretched stench. She couldn't sleep with the screams of                   torture victims all around her. All she could do was sit                   curled up in one corner of the room, trembling. A week                   passed, then ten days. She managed to keep hydrated by                   drinking the filthy water pooled up on the floor, but there                   was no food. Being trapped in that kind of place, half-crazy                   from hunger, did a serious number on her mind. Did you know                   female mantises eat their mates? The screams went on day and                   night. She covered her ears but it didn't help. And then,                   she was saved... By a little black mantis, that taught her                   how to block out the screams, how to plug up her inner ears.",
"Snake            : What the hell are you talking about?",
"Drebin           : I'm saying, Snake, that when she couldn't stand the hunger                   any longer, she started feeding on the corpses... But only                   the male ones. She didn't realize who was doing it. In her                   mind, it was a female mantis, devouring her mates. It was                   like one big, twisted waking dream. There was no mantis, of                   course. It was all a hallucination. Nothing more than some                   story spun by another person she'd created inside. Her                   unstable mind was what made her so vulnerable. Later they                   ripped out what was left of her psyche with drugs and                   hypnosis, and implanted the persona of Psycho Mantis. It                   wasn't her will that controlled the BBs. It was Psycho                   Mantis, half-assimilated into her soul, pulling the strings.                   Screaming Mantis was just another puppet. Anyway, she                   survived several weeks down in that hellhole and finally got                   back to the surface. But the screams in her head didn't                   subside. They would always be with her... Only this time,                   they weren't real. The inner earplugs didn't work anymore.                   The black mantis had disappeared. There was no place left to                   escape. Which is why she was always screaming - to drown out                   the ones in her own head. But it's over now. You freed                   Mantis from that dark nightmare.",

"Naomi            : I hope you're listening. The virus you uploaded is using GW                   as a conduit to annihilate the entire AI network. It's set                   to destroy all four AIs along with JD, the core that tied                   them all together. I've set this video to play back once                   they're all gone. Sons of the Patriots was only the                   beginning. The Patriots were planning to use nanomachines to                   implement the System over the entire population. I had an                   obligation to stop it. With a little help from Sunny. She                   helped me... She believed her talents could help you all put                   GW to rest. What she created was an anti-AI FOXDIE. But this                   virus's name is FOXALIVE. It's... The conceptual opposite of                   the nanomachines that I created all those years ago. We                   wished to free the captured foxes... To let them run free in                   the wild. By the time you hear this, I'm afraid I'll be gone.                   This is a strange feeling... Leaving a message to be                   delievered after you've died. Hal... If you're listening...",

"Liquid Ocelot    : Stopped you?",
"Liquid Ocelot    : Why would I want to do that? This is just as I'd hoped                   things would end. Back before father's time... Before Zero                   gave birth to the Patriots... The US, China, and the Soviet                   Union, formed a secret pact.",
"Liquid Ocelot    : The organization they created was called the Philosophers.                   Through two world wars, it spread its roots and extended its                   reach. After that, the Philosophers splintered, and factions                   began to squabble over the fortune they'd amassed. They                   called it the 'Philosophers' Legacy'... A massive cache of                   funds that would later provide the foundation for Zero's                   Patriots. Zero sought to use his riches to achieve world                   domination. Our father - Big Boss - sought to free himself                   from that chokehold. His dream was to create an army of free                   citizens, one that answered to no government... Outer                   Heaven. But he failed, because of you. Nine years ago, I                   tried to free us from the control of our genes. Four years                   later, our dear brother - Solidus - sought to free us from                   the control of the Patriots' memes. All of that - all of it                   - was nothing more than a process of trial and error... The                   end result of which is Outer Haven. To be free from Sons of                   the Patriots, the ultimate form of external control imposed                   on the Patriots' soldiers.",
"Liquid Ocelot    : Free from FOXDIE... Free from the System... Free from ID                   control. Our minds free from their prisons. That is the                   haven I've yearned for.",
"Liquid Ocelot    : This is it, brother. Our final moment. The battle has                   ended... But we are not yet free. The war is over... But...                   We still have a score to settle.",

Fire will spread across the world. The people will                   fight... And through battle they will know the fullness of                   life. At last... Our father's will... His Outer Heaven... Is                   complete.",

You're staring at a former child soldier. My                   parents, brothers and sisters... All killed in the war.                   Guess that makes me what you'd call a war orphan. After                   that, the Patriots picked me up and brought me into the                   family business. I was Drebin 893. There's a whole lotta                   pawns like me all over the world. How you suppose I                   laundered guns like I did? 'Cause they let me. In fact...

Who's                   gonna pick up the tab? I'm sure these new governments will                   try and keep it under control with PMC corporate reform                   laws... But it ain't gonna be good enough. They're all sunk                   up to their eyeballs in the war economy. Might not be a New                   World Order... But the old order under the war economy's                   gone for good. I'm guessin' the UN is gonna be more                   important than ever, what with multilateralism and all. A                   certain President said it best back during the Cold War...                   For in the development of this organization rests the only                   true alternative to war. Then again, the UN itself's just an                   old 20th-century relic. And if you think about it... When                   you look at its history...

"Big Boss         : He was a perfect clone. Zero, and the proxy AIs that came                   after him, were convinced that Solidus was me. I was                   implanted with nanomachines... Kept in a state of eternal                   sleep... By JD the proxy AI. They had me sealed away                   completely... Not only physical body, but my will, too. The                   technology was similar to what they used to restrain the B&B                   members you encountered. For me to wake again... The System                   had to be destroyed... One way or another. Ocelot and EVA                   wanted two things... To bring me back to life, and to end                   the Patriots. That meant destroying the AI and killing the                   man... JD and Zero. Right before you uploaded the virus into                   GW... The way to JD was opened, but only through the                   physical manifestation of GW. That's when we finally learned                   the location of this man... Zero. For me, and for them...                   For Naomi... Nothing was more important. And it was for that                   they put their grand scheme into motion. EVA stole my body                   from them and reconstructed it by replacing the missing                   parts with pieces from Liquid and Solidus. And Ocelot... In                   order to fool the System... Used nanomachines and                   psychotherapy to transplant Liquid's personality onto his                   own. He used hypnotic suggestion to turn himself into                   Liquid's mental doppelganger. For all our advances in                   nanotechnology... Information and genetic control... They've                   never managed to control people at will... Let alone turn                   one person totally into another.",
"Big Boss         : Under certain conditions, someone can be made to play a                   specific role... Act like someone else. Cats... Do love to                   play as snakes. It all started with him... Zero.",
"Big Boss         : Zero grew old, and by the end, his Patriots were being run                   by a network without shape or form.",
"Snake            : What do you mean without shape or form?",
"Big Boss         : The proxies were only one small part of the vast cycle that                   Zero created. The corporations, for-profits... And research                   institutions that comprise the military-industrial complex                   were part of it, too. They operated on budgets automatically                   allotted to them by the proxies... Accounts maintained by                   the Patriots. The network covered everything from weapons                   R&D and investment to production and marketing. It                   encompassed the people, the companies - even the laws that                   protect them. Politics and economics became nothing more                   than iterations of the same oppressively uniform system. I                   don't think anyone realized that it was all a setup... A                   mere set of norms. The Patriots were those norms - a neural                   network reduced to its simplest form. That's what they                   really represented... Uniformity without individual will,                   without change. But then one day, those norms suddenly                   deviated from that pattern, and underwent a mutation. It was                   like the birth of a new life form... The System found a new                   way to propagate itself... War. The norms the Patriots had                   crafted for their unified state quickly became dependent on                   a single business... The war economy. Meanwhile, the                   political cause of creating a 'cleaner, safer battlefield'                   provided a convenient catalyst. By then, the System was no                   longer being steered by Zero's will -- or anyone else's. It                   was then that the norms - manifested as AIs, the inheritors                   of Zero's will... Began to reproduce and take on a life of                   their own. Zero's original intent was to carry on The Boss's                   will and establish a unified world state... An inside world.                   But his successors failed to carry on his will. Eventually,                   JD became the very age itself, propagating its will as it                   pleased. And this age chose to act through economics instead                   of nation-states. Powered by the industrial and digital                   revolutions that came before it... this age gave birth to a                   twisted economic revolution - a battlefield revolution. It                   created a new world without substance. In this new world,                   there were no ideologies, no principles, no ideals... Not                   even the thing she treasured most... Loyalty. There was only                   the war economy. It was a colossal error in judgment - one                   Zero couldn't possibly have forseen.",
"Big Boss         : With the American system in a state of collapse... The                   Patriots' society has reverted to a blank slate. This man                   was the source of it all. And he doesn't even realize it.                   He's completely unaware of the fact that he led the world to                   the brink of ruin. Even with so much bad blood between us...                   It's funny... Now that I'm actually face to face with him                   again... The hatred is gone. All I feel is a deep sense of                   longing. And pity. Did Zero really hate me? Or... Did he                   fear me? It's too late to ask him now. The original                   members... Para-Medic... Sigint... EVA... Ocelot. They've                   all passed on. Only Zero is left. Everything has its                   beginning... But doesn't start at 'one.' It starts long                   before that... In chaos. The world is born... From zero. The                   moment zero becomes one is the moment the world springs to                   life. One becomes two... Two becomes 10... 10 becomes 100.                   Taking it all back to one solves nothing. So long as zero                   remains... One... Will eventually grow to 100 again. And                   so... Our goal... Was to erase Zero. Even the mighty                   Patriots began with a single man. That one man's desires                   grew huge... Bloated. Absorbed technology began to                   manipulate the economy. We realized too late... That we had                   created a beast. We had helped turn Zero... Into 100. His                   sin... Was ours. And for that reason... I'm taking it upon                   myself to send Zero... Back to nothing.",

In the end, they're no more than a program. All they                   can do is repeat the same pattern over and over again. Do me                   a favor, will you? Take me over to her. There's one more                   thing Naomi wanted me to tell you. About the... Old FOXDIE                   in your body... The only that mutated. The new FOXDIE inside                   you continues to multiply. At the same time... It is                   preventing the old... Mutated FOXDIE from reproducing. The                   new FOXDIE is uprooting the old. Naomi confirmed it in her                   follow-up. The mutants are receding. Before long, they'll be                   gone entirely.",

If you'd been in my place back then... Maybe you                   wouldn't have made the same mistakes that I did. Ever since                   the day I killed The Boss... With my own hands... I... Was                   already dead. Boss... You were right. It's not about                   changing the world. It's about doing our best to leave the                   world... The way it is. It's about respecting the will of                   others... And believing in your own. Isn't that... What you                   fought for? At last... I understand the meaning behind what                   you did. At last... I understand the truth behind your                   courage. It's almost time for me to go. And with me... The                   last ember of this fruitless war dies out. And at last those                   old evils will be gone. Once the source of evil returns to                   zero... A new one... A new future... Will be born. That new                   world... Is yours to live in. Not as a snake... But... As a                   man. Know this... Zero and I... Liquid and Solidus... We all                   fought a long, bloody war for our liberty. We fought to free                   ourselves from nations... And systems... And norms, and                   ages. But no matter how hard we tried, the only liberty we                   found... Was on the inside... Trapped within those limits.                   The Boss and I may have chosen different paths... But in the                   end, we were both trapped inside the same cage... Liberty.                   But you... You have been given freedom. Freedom to be...                   Outside. You are nobody's tool now... No one's toy. You are                   no longer a prisoner of fate. You are no longer a seed of                   war. It's time for you to see the outside world with your                   own eyes. Your body... And your soul... Are your own. Forget                   about us. Live... For yourself. And find... A new lease on                   life. Boss... You only need one snake. No... The world would                   be better off without snakes. This is good... Isn't it?",

"Otacon           : Snake?",
"Snake            : These things will kill ya.",
"Otacon           : Where will you go...? Our fight is finished. There's nothing                   left for us to do.",
"Snake            : No. There's one thing I still have to do. I have to see this                   age off... See what the future brings.",
"Otacon           : Sounds good to me. I'll go with you.",
"Snake            : Otacon, I'm gonna be dead soon. You don't have to come.",
"Otacon           : You said it yourself, Snake. There's nothing inside you can                   pass on to the next generation. No genes, no memes... You're                   man-made... You're a beast.",
"Snake            : I know... A blue rose. There won't be any happy 'Beauty and                   the Beast' ending for me. What little time I have left will                   be spent living... As a beast. A shadow of the inside... Of                   the old age.",
"Otacon           : Exactly. That's why you need me. As a witness.",
"Snake            : A witness?",
"Otacon           : Yeah. Someone on the outside to bear witness to your final                   days. Someone to pass on your story... Not that I'm the only                   witness. But I'll remember everything you were... And stick                   with you to the end.",
"Snake            : Otacon....",
"Otacon           : Besides, you wouldn't let me suffer Sunny's eggs alone,                   would you?",
"Sunny            : Come quick! They're ready! They look...yummy. Sorta like the                   sun... It's rising again.",

"Lokir: Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was       nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen       that horse and been half way to Hammerfell. You there. You and me -- we       should be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.",

"Hadvar: • You picked a bad time to come home to Skyrim, kinsman.        • Not many wood elves would choose to come alone to Skyrim.        • You from Daggerfall, Breton? Fleeing from some court intrigue?        • You from one of the strongholds, Orc? How did you end up here?        • Are you a relative of one of the Riften dock workers, Argonian?        • Another refugee? Gods really have abandoned your people, dark elf.        • You're a long way from the Imperial City. What're you doing in          Skyrim?        • What are you doing here, Redguard? You a sellsword? A sailor from          Stros M'kai?        • You with one of the trade caravans, Khajiit? Your kind always seems          to find trouble.        • You're not with the Thalmor Embassy, are you, high elf? No, that          can't be right...",
"Captain, what should we do? He's not on the list.",
"Imperial Captain: Forget the list. He goes to the block.",
"Hadvar: By your orders, captain.",
"Follow the Captain, prisoner.",
"Tullius: Ulfric Stormcloak. Some here in Helgen call you a hero, but a hero         doesn't use a power like the Voice to murder his king and usurp his         throne.",
"Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak: (grunting protest)",
"Tullius: You started this war, plunged Skyrim into chaos and now the Empire is         going to put you down, and restore the peace.",
"Hadvar: What was that?",
"Tullius: It's nothing. Carry on.",
"Imperial Captain: Yes, General Tullius. Give them their last rites.",

"This way!",
"Ralof: Jarl Ulfric! What is that thing? Could the legends be true?",
"Ulfric: Legends don't burn down villages. We need to move, now!",
"Ralof: Up through the tower. Let's go! This way, friend! Move!",
"Stormcloak Soldier: We just need to move some of these rocks to clear the way!",
"Ralof: Get back!",
"Alduin: Toor shul! {'Inferno Sun'}",

"Hadvar: Still alive, prisoner? Keep close to me if you want to stay that way.        Gunnar, take care of the boy. I have to find General Tullius and join        the defense.",

"Hadvar: Ralof! You damned traitor, out of my way!",
"Ralof: We're escaping, Hadvar! You're not stopping us this time.",
"Hadvar: Fine. I hope that dragon takes you all to Sovngarde.",
"Ralof: You, come on! Into the keep!",
"Hadvar: With me, prisoner! Let's go! Come on! We need to get inside!",
"Hadvar: Looks like we're the only ones who made it. Was that really a dragon?        The bringers of the End Times? We should keep moving. Come here. Let me        see if I can get those bindings off. There you go. Take a look around,        there should be plenty of gear to choose from. I'm going to see if I        can find something for these burns. You better get that armor on. Give        sword a few swings, too. Let's keep moving. That thing is still out        there. Come on, this way.",
"Stormcloak Soldier: We need to get moving! That dragon is tearing up the whole                    keep!",
"Stormcloak Soldier 2: Just give me a minute...I'm out of breath...",
"Hadvar: Hear that? Stormcloaks. Maybe we can reason with them. Hold on now, we        only want to...",
"Hadvar: If you want to die, so be it.",
"Hadvar: That's the end of that. Let's see if I can get that door open.",
"Hadvar: Look out! Damn, that dragon doesn't give up easy.",
"Stormcloak: What are you doing? We need to get out of Helgen now!",
"Stormcloak 2: The Imperials have potions in here. We're going to need them.",
"Hadvar: An old storeroom. See if you can find some potions. Might come in        handy.",
"Hadvar: Done then? This way!",
"Hadvar: A torture room. Gods, I wish we didn't need these...",
"Torturer: You fellows happened along just in time. These boys seemed quite          upset at how I'd been entertaining their comrades.",
"Hadvar: Don't you even know what's going on? A dragon is attacking Helgen!",
"Torturer: A dragon? Please. Don't make up nonsense...although, come to think          of it, I did hear some odd noises coming from over there.",
"Hadvar: Come with us. We need to get out of here.",
"Torturer: You have no authority over me, boy.",
"Hadvar: Didn't you hear me? I said the keep is under attack!",
"Torturer's Assistant: Forget the old man. I'll come with you.",
"Hadvar: Wait a second, looks like there's something in this cage.",
"Torturer: Don't bother with that. Lost the key ages ago. Poor fellow          screamed for weeks.",
"Hadvar: See if you can get it open with some picks. We'll need everything we        can get.",
"Torturer: Sure, take all my things. Please.",
"Hadvar: Grab what you can and let's go.",
"Torturer: There's no way out that way, you know...",
"Hadvar: Alright, let's see if we can find a way out. Let's see where this goes.",
"Hadvar: Damn it. No going back that way. I guess we're lucky that didn't come        down on top of us. We better push on. I'm sure the others will find        another way out.",
"Hadvar: Hmm, that doesn't go anywhere. I guess we'd better try this way.",
"Hadvar: What next, giant snakes?",
"Hadvar: Hold up. There's a bear just ahead. See her? I'd rather not tangle with        her right now. We might be able to sneak by. Just take it nice and        slow, and watch where you step. Or if you're feeling lucky, you can        take this bow. Might take her by surprise. Go ahead. I'll follow your        lead and watch your back.",
"Hadvar: This looks like the way out! I was starting to wonder if we'd ever make        it.",
"Hadvar: Wait!",
"Hadvar: Looks like he's gone for good this time. But I don't think we should        stick around to see if he comes back. Closest town from here is        Riverwood. My uncle's the blacksmith there. I'm sure he could help you        out. It's probably best if we split up. Good luck. I wouldn't have made        it without your help today. Listen, you should go to Solitude and join        up with the Imperial Legion. We could really use someone like you. And        if the rebels have themselves a dragon, General Tullius is the only one        who can stop them.",
"Ralof: We'll meet again in Sovngarde, brother. Looks like we're the only ones       who made it. That thing was a dragon. No doubt. Just like the children's       stories and the legends. The harbingers of the End Times. We better get       moving. Come here, let me see if I can get those bindings off. There you       go. May as well take Gunjar's gear...he won't be needing it anymore.       Alright, get that armor on and give that axe a few swings. I'm going to       see if I can find some way out of here. This one's locked. Let's see       about that gate. Damn. No way to open this from our side.",
"Imperial Captain: Come on, soldier! Keep moving!",
"Ralof: It's the Imperials! Take cover!",
"Imperial Captain: Get this gate open.",
"Ralof: Imperial dogs!",
"Ralof: Maybe one of these Imperials had the key. Let's see here... Here we       are, found a key. Let's see if it opens that door. That's it! Come on,       let's get out of here before the dragon brings the whole tower down on       our heads.",
"Ralof: Look out! Damn, that dragon doesn't give up easy.",
"Imperial Soldier: Grab everything important and let's move! The dragon is                  burning everything to the ground.",
"Imperial Soldier 2: Just need to gather some more potions.",
"Ralof: A storeroom. See if you can find any potions. We'll need them. Done?       Let's get moving.",
"Ralof: Troll's blood! It's a torture room. Hear that?",
"Ralof: Is Jarl Ulfric with you?",
"Stormcloak Soldier: No, I haven't seen him since the dragon showed up.",
"Ralof: Wait a second. Looks like there's something in this cage. It's locked.       See if you can get it open with some picks. We might need that gold once       we get out. Grab anything useful and let's go.",
"Imperial Soldier: The orders are to wait until General Tullius arrives.",
"Imperial Soldier 2: I'm not waiting to be killed by a dragon!",
"Ralof: Let's go on ahead. See if the way is clear. Let's see where this goes.",
"Ralof: No going back that way, now. We'd better push on. The rest of them will       have to find another way out.",
"Ralof: Hmm, that doesn't go anywhere. I guess we'd better try this way.",
"Ralof: I hate those damn things. Too many eyes, you know?",
"Ralof: Hold up. There's a bear just ahead. See her? I'd rather no tangle with       her right now. Let's try to sneak by. Just take it nice and slow, and       watch where you step. Or if you're feeling lucky, you can take this bow.       Might take her by surprise. Go ahead. I'll follow your lead and watch       your back.",
"Ralof: That looks like the way out! I knew we'd make it!",
"Ralof: Wait! There he goes. Looks like he's gone for good this time. No way to       know if anyone else made it out alive. But this place is going to be       swarming with Imperials soon enough. We'd better clear out of here. My       sister Gerdur runs the mill in Riverwood, just up the road. I'm sure       she'd help you out. It's probably best if we split up. Good luck. I       wouldn't have made it without your help today. You know, you should go       to Windhelm and join the fight for free Skyrim. You've seen the true       face of the Empire here today. If anyone will know what the coming of       the dragon means, it's Ulfric.",
"Ralof: See that ruin up there? Bleak Falls Barrow. I never understood how my       sister could stand living in the shadow of that place. I guess you get       used to it.",
"These are the Guardian Stones, three of the thirteen ancient standing       stones that dot Skyrim's landscape. Go ahead, see for yourself.",
"Remember, this isn't Stormcloak territory. If we're ahead of the news       from Helgen, we should be fine as long as we don't do anything stupid.       If we run into any Imperials, just let me do the talking, alright? I'm       glad you decided to come with me. We're almost to Riverwood.",
"Ralof: Looks like nobody here knows what happened yet. Come on. Gerdur's       probably working in her lumber mill.",
"Ralof: Gerdur!",
"Gerdur: Brother! Mara's mercy, it's good to see you!",
"Ralof: Gerdur...",
"Gerdur: But is it safe for you to be here? We heard that Ulfric had been        captured...",
"Ralof: Gerdur, I'm fine. At least now I am.",
"Gerdur: Are you hurt? What's happened? And who's this? One of your comrades?",
"Ralof: Not a comrade yet, but a friend. I owe him my life, in fact. Is there       somewhere we can talk? There's no telling when the news from Helgen will       reach the Imperials...",
"Gerdur: Helgen? Has something happened...? You're right. Follow me. Hod! Come        here a minute. I need your help with something.",
"Hod: What is it, woman? Sven drunk on the job again?",
"Gerdur: Hod, just come here.",
"Hod: Ralof! What are you doing here? Ahh...I'll be right down.",
"Frodnar: Uncle Ralof! Can I see your axe? How many Imperials have you killed?         Do you really know Ulfric Stormcloak?",
"Gerdur: Hush, Frodnar. This is no time for your games. Go and watch the south        road. Come find us if you see any Imperial soldiers coming.",
"Frodnar: Aw, mama, I wanna stay and talk with Uncle Ralof!",
"Ralof: Look at you, almost a grown man! Won't be very long before you'll be       joining the fight yourself.",
"Frodnar: That's right! Don't worry, Uncle Ralof, I won't let those soldiers         sneak up on you.",
"Hod: Now, Ralof, what's going on? You two look pretty well done in.",
"Ralof: I can't remember when I last slept... Where to start? Well, the news you       heard about Ulfric was true. The Imperials ambushed us outside Darkwater       Crossing. Like they knew exactly where we'd be...that was two days ago,       now. We stopped in Helgen this morning, and I thought it was all over.       Had us lined up to the headsman's block and ready to start chopping.",
"Gerdur: The cowards!",
"Ralof: They wouldn't dare give Ulfric a fair trial. Treason, for fighting for       your own people! All of Skyrim would've seen the truth then. But then,       out of nowhere...a dragon attacked!",
"Gerdur: You don't mean a real, live...",
"Ralof: I can hardly believe it myself, and I was there. As strange as it       sounds, we'd be dead if not for that dragon. In the confusion, we       managed to slip away. Are we really the first to make it to Riverwood?",
"Gerdur: Nobody else has come up the south road today, as far as I know.",
"Ralof: Good. Maybe we can lay up for a while. I hate to put your family in       danger, Gerdur, but...",
"Gerdur: Nonsense. You and your friend are welcome to stay here as long as you        need to. Let me worry about the Imperials. Any friend of Ralof's is a        friend of mine. Here's a key to the house. Stay as long as you like.        If there's anything else you need, just let me know.",
"There's something you can do for me. For all of us here. The Jarl needs        to know if there's a dragon on the loose. Riverwood is defenseless...        We need to get word to Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun to send whatever        soldiers he can. If you'll do that for me, I'll be in your debt.",
"Ralof: Thanks, sister. I knew I could count on you.",
"Gerdur: I ought to get back to work before I'm missed, but...did anyone else        escape? Did Ulfric...",
"Ralof: Don't worry, I'm sure he made it out. It would take more than a dragon       to stop Ulfric Stormcloak.",
"Hod: I'll let them into the house, and, you know, show them where everything     is.",
"Gerdur: Hmph, help them drink up our mead, you mean... Good luck, brother. I'll        see you later.",
"Ralof: Don't worry about me. I know how to lay low.",
"Ralof: I told you my sister would help us out. I hope to see you in Windhelm.       Good luck. May the gods watch over your battles, friend.",
"Hadvar: See that ruin up there? Bleak Falls Barrow. When I was a boy, that        place always used to give me nightmares. Draugr creeping down the        mountain to climb through my window at night, that kind of thing. I        admit, I still don't much like the look of it.",
"These are the Guardian Stones, three of the thirteen ancient standing        stones that dot Skyrim's landscape. Go ahead, see for yourself.",
"Listen, as far as I'm concerned, you've already earned your pardon. But        until we get that confirmed by General Tullius, just stay clear of        other Imperial soldiers and avoid any complications, all right? I'm        glad you decided to come with me. We're almost to Riverwood.",
"Hadvar: Things look quiet enough here. Come on, there's my uncle. Uncle Alvor!        Hello!",
"Alvor: Hadvar? What are you doing here? Are you on leave from... Shor's bones,       what happened to you, boy? Are you in some kind of trouble?",
"Hadvar: Shh, uncle. Keep your voice down. I'm fine, but we should go inside to        talk.",
"Alvor: What's going on? And who's this?",
"Hadvar: He's a friend. Saved my life in fact. Come on, I'll explain everything,        but we need to go inside.",
"Alvor: Okay, okay. Come inside, then. Sigrid will get you something to eat and       you can tell me all about it.",
"Alvor: Sigrid! We have company!",
"Sigrid: Hadvar! We've been so worried about you! Come, you two must be hungry.        Sit down and I'll get you something to eat.",
"Alvor: Now, then, boy. What's the big mystery? What were you doing, looking       like you lost an argument with a cave bear?",
"Hadvar: I don't know where to start. I was assigned to General Tullius's guard.        We were stopped in Helgen when we were attacked...by a dragon.",
"Alvor: A dragon? That's...ridiculous. You aren't drunk, are you, boy?",
"Sigrid: Husband, let him tell his story.",
"Hadvar: Not much more to tell. This dragon flew over and just wrecked the whole        place. Mass confusion. I don't know if anyone else got out alive. I        doubt I'd have made it out if not for my friend here. I need to get        back to Solitude and let them know what's happened. I thought you could        help us out. Food, supplies, a place to stay.",
"Alvor: Of course! Any friend of Hadvar's is a friend of mine. I'm glad to help       in any way I can. Like I said, I'm glad to help. But I need your help.       We need your help. The Jarl needs to know there's a dragon on the loose.       Riverwood is defenseless... We need to get word to Jarl Balgruuf in       Whiterun to send whatever soldiers he can. If you'll do that for me,       I'll be in your debt.",
"Dorthe: Hadvar, did you really see a dragon? What did it look like? Did it have        big teeth?",
"Sigrid: Hush, child. Don't pester your cousin.",
"Alvor: Well, I better get back to work. You two can make yourselves at home.",
"Hadvar: It's nice to be back in a friendly spot, huh? Listen, I'm going to lay        up here for awhile. You can make your own way to Solitude from here. I        recommend heading to Whiterun, just down the road from here. From there        you can take a carriage to Solitude.",
"Guard: Halt! City's closed with dragons about. Official business only.",
"Riverwood calls for the Jarl's aid.²       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Riverwood's in danger, too? You better go on in. You'll find the Jarl        at Dragonsreach, atop the hill.",
"Will this change your mind? (### gold)       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Welcome to Whiterun, friend. Go right in.",
"Stand aside, or else. (Intimidate)       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Or else what? You think you can stand against the entire Whiterun city        guard? The gate's closed.",
"Proventus Avenicci: I only council caution. We cannot afford to act rashly in                     times like these.",
"Jarl Balgruuf the Greater: What would you have me do, then? Nothing?",
"Proventius: My lord, please. This is no time for rash action. I just think we            need more action before we act. I just...",
"Jarl Balgruuf: Who's this, then?",
"Irileth: What's the meaning of this interruption? Jarl Balgruuf is not         receiving any visitors.",
"Alvor sent me. Riverwood is in danger.²         Gerdur sent me. Riverwood is in danger.²         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          As Housecarl, my job is to deal with all dangers that Jarl or his          people. So, you have my attention. Now, explain yourself.",
"Balgruuf: It's all right, Irileth. I want to hear what he has to                      say.",
"Balgruuf: What's this about Riverwood being in danger?",
"Not prone to flights of fancy...",
"Balgruuf: • So, you were at Helgen? You saw this dragon with your own eyes?          • And you're sure Helgen was destroyed by a dragon? This wasn't some            Stormcloak raid gone wrong?",
"Yes. I had a great view while the Imperials were trying to cut off          my head. |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Really? You're certainly...forthright about your criminal past. But           it's none of my concern who the Imperials want to execute.           Especially now. What I want to know is what exactly happened at           Helgen.",
"The Imperials were about to execute Ulfric Stormcloak. Then the          dragon attacked. |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I should have guessed Ulfric would be mixed up in this.",
"The dragon destroyed Helgen. And last I saw it was heading this way.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           By Ysmir, Irileth was right!",
"What do you say now, Proventus? Shall we continue to trust in the          strength of our walls? Against a dragon?",
"Irileth: My lord, we should send troops to Riverwood at once. It's in the most         immediate danger. If that dragon is lurking in the mountains...",
"Proventus: The Jarl of Falkreath will view that as a provocation! He'll assume           we're preparing to join Ulfric's side and attack him! We should           not--",
"Balgruuf: Enough! I'll not stand idly by while a dragon burns my hold and          slaughters my people! Irileth, send a detachment to Riverwood at          once.",
"Irileth: Yes, my Jarl.",
"Proventus: If you'll excuse me, I'll return to my duties.",
"Balgruuf: That would be best.",
"Balgruuf: Well done. You sought me out, on your own initiative. You've done          Whiterun a service, and I won't forget it. Here, take this as a small          token of my esteem. There is another thing you could do for me.          Suitable for someone of your particular talents, perhaps. Come, let's          go find Farengar, my court wizard. He's been looking into a matter          related to these dragons and...rumors of dragons.",
"Balgruuf: Farengar, I think I've found someone who can help you with your          dragon project. Go ahead and fill him in with all the details.",
"Farengar: So the Jarl thinks you can be of use to me? Oh yes, he must be          referring to my research into the dragons. Yes, I could use someone          to fetch something for me. Well, when I say fetch, I really mean          delve into a dangerous ruin in search of an ancient stone tablet that          may or may not actually be there.",
"All right. Where am I going and what am I fetching?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Straight to the point, eh? No need for tedious hows and whys. I           like that. Leave those details to your betters, am I right?",
"What does this have to do with dragons?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Ah, no mere brute mercenary, but a thinker -- perhaps even a           scholar? You see, when the stories of dragons began to circulate,           many dismissed them as mere fantasties, rumors. Impossibilities.           One sure mark of a fool is to dismiss anything that falls outside           his experience as being impossible. But I began to search for           information about dragons -- where had they gone all those years           ago? And where were they coming from?",
"So what do you need me to do?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            {skip to 'I, ah, learned...'}",
"Just tell me what you need me to do.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           You are eager to begin your adventure. Excellent. The sooner begun,           the sooner done, eh?",
"Oh, you mean this old stone? (Give Dragonstone to Farengar)²          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! You already found it! You           are cut from a different cloth than the usual brutes the Jarl foists           on me. (skip to 'So what about my reward' turn-in options)",
"Dragonborn: What can you tell me about Bleak Falls Barrow?",
"Farengar: An old tomb, built by the ancient Nords, perhaps dating back to the          Dragon War itself. Ah. Maybe you just want to know how to get there.          It's near Riverwood, a miserable little village a few miles south of          here. I'm sure some of the locals can point you in the right          direction once you get there.",
"Dragonborn: How do you know this stone tablet is in Bleak Falls Barrow?",
"Farengar: Well. Must preserve some professional secrets, mustn't we? I have my          sources...reliable sources.",
"Dragonborn: Tell me more about the Dragon War.",
"Farengar: I'm not surprised you've never heard of it. Even I used to think it          was just a myth. But not anymore. The Dragon War was a real event,          although only the barest glimmer of the actual events has come down          to us. Far back in the Mythic Era, the dragons were worshipped as          gods in Skyrim. Many of the monumental ruins that still dot the          landscape were, in fact, built as temples to the dragons. The details          are lost, but at some point the Nords rebelled. After a long and          terrible war, the Nords overthrew their dragon overlords.",
"Dragonborn: So, were all the dragons killed in the Dragon War?",
"Farengar: Oh, no. Many were killed, of course. But many survived into          historical times. Why, this very palace was built by one of          Balgruuf's ancestors to hold a captive dragon. Hence its name --          Dragonsreach.",
"Dragonborn: Have you encountered any dragons?",
"Farengar: Sadly, no. My work affords me few opportunities for such an          adventure. Perhaps some hero will bring one to Dragonsreach, like          old Olaf One-Eye once did. What a fascinating conversation that would          be!",
"Bandit 1: The dark elf wants to go on ahead, let him. Better than us risking          our necks.",
"Bandit 2: What if Arvel doesn't come back? I want my share from that claw!",
"Bandit 1: Just shut it and keep an eye out for trouble.",
"Arvel: Is...is someone coming? Is that you Harknir? Bjorn? Soling? No. Not       again! Ah, kill it. Kill it! Get me out of here!",
"Arvel: You. Over here! You did it. You killed it. Now cut me down before       anything else shows up.",
"Dragonborn: Where's the golden claw?",
"Arvel: Yes, the claw. I know how it works. The claw, the markings, the door in       the Hall of Stories. I know how they all fit together! Help me down,       and I'll show you. You won't believe the power the Nords have hidden       there.",
"Hand over the claw first!       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Does it look like I can move? You have to cut me down, first.",
"Fine. Let me see if I can cut you down.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Sweet breath of Arkay, thank you.",
"Arvel: It's coming loose. I can feel it.",
"Arvel: You fool, why should I share the treasure with anyone?",
"Farengar: You see? The terminology is clearly First Era or even earlier. I'm          convinced this is a copy of a much older text. Perhaps dating to just          after the Dragon War. If so, I could use this to cross-refernence          the names with the other later texts.",
"Delphine: Good. I'm glad you're making progress. My employers are anxious to          have some tangible answers.",
"Farengar: Oh, have no fear. The Jarl himself has finally taken an interest, so          I'm now able to devote most of my time to this research.",
"Delphine: Time is running, Farengar, don't forget. This isn't some theoretical          question. Dragons have come back.",
"Farengar: Yes, yes. Don't worry. Although the chance to see a living dragon up          close would be tremendously valuable... Now, let me show you          something else I found...very intriguing...I think your employers          may be interested as well... Hmm? Ah, yes, the Jarl's protege¹! Back          from Bleak Falls Barrow? You didn't die, it seems.",
"Farengar: Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! Seems you are a cut above          the usual brutes the Jarl sends my way.",
"So what about my reward?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           You'll have to see the Jarl about that. Maybe his steward, Avenicci.           I'm sure one of them will pay you appropriately.",
"My...associate here will be pleased to see your handiwork. She          discovered its location, by means she has so far declined to share          with me. So, your information was correct after all. And we have our          friend to thank for recovering it for us.",
"Delphine: You went into Bleak Falls Barrow and got that? Nice work. Just send          me a copy when you've deciphered it.",
"Irileth: Farengar! Farengar, you need to come at once. A dragon's been sighted         nearby. You should come, too.",
"Farengar: A dragon! How exciting! Where was it seen? What was it doing?",
"Irileth: I'd take this a bit more seriously if I were you. If a dragon decides         to attack Whiterun I don't know if we can stop it. Let's go.",
"Balgruuf: So, Irileth tells me you came from the western watchtower.",
"Whiterun Guard: Yes, my lord.",
"Irileth: Tell him what you told me. About the dragon.",
"Whiterun Guard: Uh...that's right. We saw it coming from the south. It was                fast...faster than anything I've ever seen.",
"Balgruuf: What did it do? Is it attacking the watchtower?",
"Whiterun Guard: No, my lord. It was just circling overhead when I left. I never                ran so fast in my life...I thought it would come after me for                sure.",
"Balgruuf: Good work, son. We'll take it from here. Head down to the barracks          for some food and rest. You've earned it. Irileth, you'd better          gather some guardsmen and get down there.",
"Irileth: I've already ordered my men to muster near the main gate.",
"Balgruuf: Good. Don't fail me.",
"Balgruuf: There's no time to stand on ceremony, my friend. I need your help          again. I want you to go with Irileth and help her fight this dragon.          You survived Helgen, so you have more experience with dragons than          anyone else here. But I haven't forgotten the service you did for me          in retrieving the Dragonstone for Farengar. As a token of my esteem,          I have instructed Avenicci that you are now permitted to purchase          property in the city. And please accept this gift from my personal          armory.",
"Farengar: I should come along. I would very much like to see this dragon.",
"Balgruuf: No. I can't afford to risk both of you. I need you here working on          ways to defend the city against these dragons.",
"Farengar: As you command.",
"Balgruuf: One last thing, Irileth. This isn't a death or glory mission. I need          to know what we're dealing with.",
"Irileth: Don't worry, my lord. I'm the very soul of caution.",
"Irileth: Here's the situation. A dragon is attacking the Western Watchtower.",
"Whiterun Guard: What?",
"Whiterun Guard: A dragon?",
"Whiterun Guard: We're in for it.",
"Irileth: You heard right! I said a dragon! I don't much care where it came from         or who sent it. What I do know is it's made the mistake of attacking         Whiterun!",
"Whiterun Guard: But Housecarl...how can we attack a dragon?",
"Irileth: That's a fair question. None of us have ever seen a dragon before, or",
"Whiterun Guard: We're so dead...",
"Irileth: But it's more than our honor at stake here. Think of it -- the first         dragon seen in Skyrim since the last age. The glory of killing it is         ours, if you're with me! Now what do you say? Shall we go kill us a         dragon?",
"Whiterun Guard: Yeah!",
"Whiterun Guard: Damn right!",
"Whiterun Guard: Yeah!",
"Irileth: Let's move out.",
"Irileth: No signs of any dragon right now, but it sure looks like he's been         here. I know it looks bad, but we've got to figure out what happened.         And if that dragon is still skulking around somewhere. Spread out and         look for survivors. We need to know what we're dealing with.",
"Whiterun Guard: No! Get back! It's still here somewhere! Hroki and Tor just                got grabbed when they tried to make a run for it!",
"Irileth: Guardsman! What happened here? Where's this dragon? Quickly now!",
"Whiterun Guard: I don't know! Kynareth save us, here he comes again...",
"Irileth: Here he comes! Find cover and make every arrow count!",
"Whiterun Guard: Talos save us! It's a dragon!",
"Whiterun Guard: Slay it! Slay the dragon!",
"Whiterun Guard: I can't get a bead on him!",
"Irileth: Come down here and fight, you coward!",
"Mirmulnir: Dovahkiin! No!!",
"Irileth: Let's make sure that overgrown lizard is really dead. Damned good         shooting, boys!",
"Whiterun Guard: What's happening?!",
"Irileth: Everybody get back!",
"Whiterun Guard: I can't believe it! You're...Dragonborn...",
"Dragonborn: Dragonborn? What do you mean?",
"Whiterun Guard: In the very oldest tales, back from when there were still                dragons in Skyrim, the Dragonborn would slay dragons and steal                their power. That's what you did, isn't it? Absorbed that                dragon's power?",
"According to the old legends, only the Dragonborn can Shout                without training, the way the dragons do.",
"Whiterun Guard 2: Dragonborn? What are you talking about?",
"Whiterun Guard: That's right! My grandfather used to tell stories about the                Dragonborn. Those born with the Dragon Blood in 'em. Like old                Tiber Septim himself.",
"Whiterun Guard 3: I've never heard of Tiber Septim killing any dragons.",
"Whiterun Guard: There weren't any dragons then, idiot. They're just coming                back now for the first time in...forever.",
"Whiterun Guard 4: But the old tales tell of the Dragonborn who could kill                  dragons and steal their power. You must be one!",
"Whiterun Guard 2: What do you say, Irileth? You've being awfully quiet.",
"Whiterun Guard 3: Come on, Irileth, tell us, do you believe in this Dragonborn                  business?",
"Irileth: Hmph. Some of you would be better off keeping quiet than flapping your         gums on matters you don't know anything about. Here's a dead dragon,         and that's something I definitely understand. Now we know we can kill         them. But I don't need some mythical Dragonborn. Someone who can put         down a dragon is more than enough for me.",
"Whiterun Guard 4: You wouldn't understand, Housecarl. You ain't a Nord.",
"Irileth: I've been all across Tamriel. I've seen plenty of things just as         outlandish as this. I'd advise you all to trust in the strength of         your sword over tales and legends.",
"Whiterun Guard 2: If you really are Dragonborn, like out of the old tales, you                  ought to be able to Shout. Can you? Have you tried?",
"Whiterun Guard 2: By the gods! What manner of power is that?",
"Whiterun Guard: That was Shouting, what you just did! Must be. You really are                Dragonborn, then...",
"Irileth: That was the hairiest fight I've ever been in, and I've been in more         than a few. I don't know about this Dragonborn business, but I'm sure         glad you're with us. You better get back to Whiterun right away. Jarl         Balgruuf will want to know what happened here.",
"Proventus: Good. You're finally here. The Jarl's been waiting for you.",
"Balgruuf: You heard the summons. What else could it mean? The Greybeards...",
"Hrongar: We were just talking about you. My brother needs a word with you.",
"Balgruuf: So what happened at the watchtower? Was the dragon there?",
"The watchtower was destroyed, but we killed the dragon.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I knew I could count on Irileth. But there must be more to it than           that.",
"Turns out I may be something called 'Dragonborn.'          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Dragonborn? What do you know about the Dragonborn?",
"That's just what the men called me.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Not just the men. The Greybeards seem to think the same thing.",
"When the dragon died, I absorbed some kind of power from it.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            So it's true. The Greybeards really were summoning you.",
"Dragonborn: The Greybeards?",
"Balgruuf: Masters of the Way of the Voice. They live in seclusion high on the          slopes of the Throat of the World.",
"Dragonborn: What do these Greybeards want with me?",
"Balgruuf: The Dragonborn is said to be uniquely gifted in the Voice -- the          ability to focus your vital essence into a Thu'um, or Shout. If you          really are Dragonborn, they can teach you how to use your gift.",
"Hrongar: Didn't you hear the thundering sound as you returned to Whiterun?         That was the voice of the Greybeards, summoning you to High Hrothgar!         This hasn't happened in...centuries, at least. Not since Tiber Septim         himself was summoned when he was still Talos of Atmora!",
"Proventus: Hrongar, calm yourself. What does any of this Nord nonsense have to           do with our friend here? Capable as he may be, I don't see any signs           of him being this, what, 'Dragonborn.'",
"Hrongar: Nord nonsense? Why you puffed-up ignorant...these are our sacred         traditions that go back to the founding of the First Empire.",
"Balgruuf: Hrongar. Don't be so hard on Avenicci.",
"Proventus: I meant no disrespect, of course. It's just that...what do these           Greybeards want with him?",
"Balgruuf: That's the Greybeards' business, not ours. Whatever happened when you          killed that dragon, it revealed something in you, and the Greybeards          heard it. If they think you're Dragonborn, who are we to argue? You'd          better get up to High Hrothgar immediately. There's no refusing the          summons of the Greybeards. It's a tremendous honor. I envy you, you          know. To climb the 7,000 Steps again...I made the pilgrimage once,          did you know that? High Hrothgar is a very peaceful place. Very...          disconnected from the troubles of this world. I wonder if the          Greybeards even notice what's going on down here. They haven't seemed          to care before. No matter. Go to High Hrothgar. Learn what the          Greybeards can teach you.",
"You've done a great service to me and my city, Dragonborn. By my          right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Whiterun. It's the greatest honor          that's within my power to grant. I assign you Lydia as a personal          housecarl, and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of          office. I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want          them to think you're part of the common rabble, now would we? We are          honored to have you as Thane of our city, Dragonborn.",
"Back to business, Proventus. We still have a city to defend.",
"Proventus: Yes, my lord.",
"Dragonborn: What's it mean to be Dragonborn?",
"Balgruuf: Well, in the old tales, the Dragonborn heroes would use the power of          their Voice to defeat the enemies of Skyrim. Wulfharth was          Dragonborn. Talos, too -- the founder of the Empire, back in the good          old days. In the very oldest tales, back from when there were still          dragons in Skyrim, the Dragonborn would slay dragons and steal their          power.",
"Dragonborn: Who are the Greybeards?",
"Balgruuf: They're the Masters of the Way of the Voice -- of Shouting. They live          up on top of the Throat of the World. If you're really Dragonborn,          they'll want to talk to you. In the old stories, they always summon          the Dragonborn for training.",
"Dragonborn: How can you protect Whiterun from the dragons?",
"Balgruuf: With good planning and constant vigilance. Even now, my court wizard,          Farengar, continues his research into ways we might drive back these          terrors. We must also have ample reserves of water to combat the          fires that will surely spread after an attack. But our greatest          weapon? Courage. For if we cannot kill the beast, we must at least          have the tenacity to drive it back. Until brave heroes step forward          to destroy these monsters, that is the best we can do.",
"Arngeir: So...a Dragonborn appears, at this moment in the turning of the age.",
"You call me Dragonborn. What does that mean?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          First, let us see if you truly are Dragonborn.",
"Let us taste of your Voice.",
"Arngeir: Dragonborn. It is you. Welcome to High Hrothgar. I am Master Arngeir.         I speak for the Greybeards. Now tell me, Dragonborn, why have you come         here?",
"Who are you? What is this place?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          We are the Greybeards, followers of the Way of the Voice. You stand          in High Hrothgar, on the slopes of Kynareth's sacred mountain. Here          we commune with the voice of the sky, and strive to achieve balance          between our inner and outer selves.",
"You mean I'm not the only Dragonborn?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           You are not the first. There have been many of the Dragon Blood           since Akatosh first bestowed that gift upon mortalkind. Whether you           are the only Dragonborn of this age...that is not ours to know. You           are the only one that has been revealed thus far. That is all I can           say.",
"Dragonborn: What is my destiny?",
"Arngeir: That is for you to discover. We can show you the Way, but not your         destination.",
"Dragonborn: I'm ready to learn.",
"Arngeir: You have shown that you are Dragonborn. You have the inborn gift. But         do you have the discipline and temperament to follow the path laid out         for you? That remains to be seen. Without training, you have already         taken the first steps toward projecting your Voice into a Thu'um, a         Shout. Not let us see if you are willing and able to learn. When you         Shout, you speak in the language of dragons. Thus, your Dragon Blood         gives you an inborn ability to learn Words of Power. All Shouts are         made up of three Words of Power. As you master each Word, your Shout         will become progressively stronger. Master Einarth will now teach you         'Ro,' the second Word in Unrelenting Force. 'Ro' means 'balance' in         the dragon tongue. Combine it with Fus -- 'Force' -- to focus your         Thu'um more sharply.",
"Einarth: Ro...",
"Arngeir: You learn a new word like a master...you truly do have the gift. But         learning a Word of Power is only the first step...you must unlock its         meaning through constant practice in order to use it in a Shout. Well,         that is how the rest of us learn Shouts. As Dragonborn, you can absorb         a slain dragon's life force and knowledge directly. As part of your         initiation, Master Einarth will allow you to tap into his         understanding of 'Ro.'",
"Arngeir: Now let us see how quickly you can master your new Thu'um. Use your         Unrelenting Force shout to strike the targets as they appear.",
"Borri: Flik Lo...Sah!",
"Arngeir: Well done. Again.",
"Einarth: Flik Lo...Sah!",
"Arngeir: You learn quickly. Once more.",
"Wulfgar: Flik Lo...Sah!",
"Arngeir: Impressive. Your Thu'um is precise. You show great promise,         Dragonborn. We will perform your next trial in the courtyard. Follow         Master Borri.",
"Arngeir: We will now see how you learn a completely new Shout. Master Borri         will teach you 'Wuld,' which means 'Whirlwind.'",
"Borri: Wuld...",
"Arngeir: You must hear the Word within yourself before you can project it into         a Thu'um.",
"Arngeir: Approach Master Borri and he will gift you his knowledge of 'Wuld.'",
"Arngeir: Now we will see how quickly you can master a new Shout. Master Wulfgar         will demonstrate Whirlwind Sprint. Then it will be your turn. Master         Borri.",
"Borri: Bex!",
"Wulfgar: Wuld. Nah...Kest!",
"Arngeir: Now it is your turn. Stand next to me. Master Borri will open the         gate. Use your Whirlwind Sprint to pass through before it closes.",
"Borri: Bex!",
"Arngeir: Your quick mastery of a new Thu'um is...astonishing. I'd heard the         stories of the abilities of Dragonborn, but to see it for myself...",
"Thank you. What's next?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          You are now ready for your last trial.",
"Retrieve the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller, our founder, from his tomb in         the ancient fane of Ustengrav. Remain true to the Way of the Voice,         and you will return.",
"Dragonborn: Why are the dragons returning? Does it have something to do with            me?",
"Arngeir: No doubt. The appearance of a Dragonborn at this time is not an         accident. Your destiny is surely bound up with the return of the         dragons. You should focus on honing your Voice, and soon your path         will be made clear.",
"Thank you, Master. I will continue my training.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Good. Then you will be ready for whatever lies ahead.",
"Surely there's more you can tell me.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          There is indeed much that we know that you do not. That does not mean          that you are ready to understand it. Do not let your easy mastery of          the Voice tempt you into the arrogance of power that has been the          downfall of many Dragonborn before you.",
"Dragonborn: What does it mean to be 'Dragonborn'?",
"Arngeir: Dragons have the inborn ability to learn and project their Voice.         Dragons are also able to absorb the power of their slain brethren. A         few mortals are born with similar abilities -- whether a gift or a         curse has been a matter of debate down through the centuries. What you         have already learned in a few days took even the most gifted of us         years to achieve. Some believe that Dragonborn are sent into the world         by the gods, at times of great need. We will speak more of that later,         when you are ready.",
"Dragonborn: Why are Shouts in the dragon language?",
"Arngeir: Dragons have always been able to shout. Language is intrinsic to their         very being. There is no difference in the dragon tongue between         debating and fighting. Shouting comes as naturally to a dragon as         breathing, or speaking. In mythic times, when mortalkind was in great         need, the goddess Kynareth granted us the ability to speak as dragons         do. For most people, long years of training are required to learn even         the simplest Shout. But for you, the dragon speech is is in your         blood, and you learn it almost without effort.",
"Dragonborn: There are only four of you?",
"Arngeir: Five. Our leader, Paarthurnax, lives alone on the peak of the Throat         of the World. When your Voice can open the path, you will know you are         ready to speak to him.",
"Dragonborn: When can I meet your leader, Paarthurnax?",
"Arngeir: As I said, you will know you are ready when your Voice can open the         path to him.",
"Dragonborn: Tell me about the Greybeards.",
"Arngeir: We study the Way of the Voice, according to the teachings of our         founder, Jurgen Windcaller. Very few are permitted to study with us         here at High Hrothgar. But in your case, Dragonborn, it is a privilege         to guide you towards mastery of your Voice.",
"Dragonborn: Why don't the others talk?",
"Arngeir: Their Voices are too powerful for anyone not trained in the Way to         withstand. Even a whisper could kill you.",
"Dragonborn: Who was Jurgen Windcaller?",
"Arngeir: He was a great war leader of the ancient Nords, a master of the Voice,         or Tongue. After the disaster at Red Mountain, where the Nord army was         annihilated, he spent many years pondering the meaning of that         terrible defeat. He finally came to realize that the gods had punished         the Nords for their arrogant and blasphemous misuse of the Voice. He         was the first to understand that the Voice should be used solely for         the glory and worship of the gods, not the glory the men. Jurgen         Windcaller's mastery of the Voice eventually overcame all opposition,         and the Way of the Voice was born.",
"Dragonborn: What is the 'Way of the Voice'?",
"Arngeir: The Voice was a gift of the goddess Kynareth, at the dawn of time. She         gave mortals the ability to speak as dragons do. Although this gift         has often been misused, the only true use of the Voice is for the         worship and glory of the gods. True Mastery of the Voice can only be         achieved when your inner spirit is in harmony with your outward         actions. In the contemplation of the sky, Kynareth's domain, and the         practice of the Voice, we strive to achieve this balance.",
"But I don't follow your philosophy. Why help me learn the Voice?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          The Dragonborn is an exception to all the rules -- the Dragon Blood          itself is a gift from the gods. If we accept one gift, how can we          deny the other? As Dragonborn, you have received the ability to Shout          directly from Akatosh. We therefore seek to guide you on the proper          use of your gift, which transcends the restrictions which bind other          mortals.",
"Conjurer: These thralls of yours are slower than Argonians in a blizzard.",
"Necromancer: Feel free to grab a pick and help them out. I prefer not to sully             myself with manual labor.",
"Conjurer: There goes another one.",
"Necromancer: Bah. Weak-willed rabble. Even dead they're almost useless.",
"Conjurer: They seem less intelligent each time you raise them, if that's even          possible.",
"Necromancer: As long as they can swing a pickaxe where I tell them, they're as             smart as we need them to be.",
"Conjurer: You hear that? The others must have found something!",
"Necromancer: We'd better go see. These can tend to themselves for a few             minutes.",
"Delphine: I'm the innkeeper. It's my business to keep track of strangers.",
"Dragonborn: I'd like to rent the attic room. (10 Gold)",
"Delphine: Attic room, eh? Well...we don't have an attic room, but you can have          the one on the left. Make yourself at home.",
"Delphine: So you're the Dragonborn I've been hearing so much about. I think          you're looking for this. We need to talk. Follow me.",
"Arngeir: Ah! You've retrieved the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller. Well done. You         have now passed all the trials. Come with me. It is time for us to         recognize you formally as Dragonborn.",
"Arngeir: You are ready to learn the final word of Unrelenting Force, 'Dah,'         which means 'Push.'",
"Wulfgar: Dah...",
"Arngeir: With all three words together, this Shout is much more powerful. Use         it wisely. Master Wulfgar will now gift you with his knowledge of         'Dah.'",
"Arngeir: You have completed your training, Dragonborn. We would Speak to you.         Stand between us, and prepare yourself. Few can withstand the         unbridled Voice of the Greybeards. But you are ready.",
"Greybeards: Lingrah krosis saraan Strundu'ul, voth nid balaan klov praan nau.            Naal Thu'umu, mu ofan nii nu, Dovahkiin, naal suleyk do Kaan, naal            suleyk do Shor, ahrk naal suleyk do Atmorasewuth. Meyz nu Ysmir,            Dovahsebrom. Dahmaan daar rok.",
"Arngeir: Dovahkiin. You have tasted the Voice of the Greybeards, and passed         through unscathed. High Hrothgar is open to you.",
"Dragonborn: What was that ceremoy all about? Were you Shouting at me?",
"Arngeir: We spoke the traditional words of greeting to a Dragonborn who has         accepted our guidance. The same words were used to greet the young         Talos, when he came to High Hrothgar, before he became the Emperor         Tiber Septim.",
"Dragonborn: What did you actually say?",
"Arngeir: Ah. I sometimes you forget you are not versed in the dragon tongue as         we are. This is a rough translation: 'Long has the Stormcrown         languished, with no worthy brow to sit upon. By our breath we bestow         it now to you in the name of Kyne, in the name of Shor, and in the         name of Atmora of Old. You are Ysmir now, the Dragon of the North,         hearken to it.'",
"Delphine: Close the door.",
"Delphine: Now we can talk. The Greybeards seem to think you're the Dragonborn.          I hope they're right.",
"You're the one who took the horn?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Surprised? I guess I'm getting pretty good at my harmless innkeeper           act.",
"What's with all the cloak and dagger?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            You can't be too careful. Thalmor spies are everywhere.",
"Here I am. What do you want?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            I didn't go to all this trouble on a whim. I needed to make sure it            wasn't a Thalmor trap.",
"Sorry, I'm supposed to be meeting someone here.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I hope you're just playing dumb. I'm the one who left the note in           Ustengrav.",
"The Greybeards are right. I am Dragonborn.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I hope so. But you'll forgive me if I don't assume that something's           true just because the Greybeards say so. I just handed you the Horn           of Jurgen Windcaller. Does that make me Dragonborn, too?",
"What do you want with me?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I didn't go to all this trouble on a whim. I needed to make sure it           wasn't a Thalmor trap. I'm not your enemy. I already gave you the           horn. I'm actually trying to help you. I just need you to hear me           out.",
"You'd better have a good reason for dragging me here.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           It was the only way I could make sure it wasn't a Thalmor trap. I'm           not your enemy. I already gave you the horn. I'm actually trying to           help you. I just need you to hear me out.",
"Go on. I'm listening.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Like I said in my note, I've heard that you might be Dragonborn.           I'm part of a group that's been looking for you...well, someone like           you, for a very long time. If you really are Dragonborn, that is.           Before I tell you any more, I need to make sure I can trust you.",
"You'd better start explaining. Fast.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I'll explain what I want when I want, got it? You'd already be dead           if I didn't like the look of you when you walked in here. But I had           to know if the rumors about you were true... I'm part of a group           that's been looking for you...well, someone like you, for a very           long time. If you really are Dragonborn, that is. Before I tell you           any more, I need to make sure I can trust you.",
"Dragonborn: So what's the part you're not telling me?",
"Delphine: Dragons aren't just coming back, they're coming back to life. They          weren't gone somewhere all these years. They were dead, killed off          centuries ago by my predecessors. Now something's happening to bring          them back to life. And I need you to help me stop it.",
"Do you know how crazy this sounds?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Ha. A few years ago, I said almost the same thing to a colleague of           mine. Well, it turned out he was right and I was wrong.",
"What makes you think dragons are coming back to life?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I know they are. I've visited their ancestral burial mounds and           found them empty. And I've figured out where the next one will come           back to life.",
"We're going to go there, and you're going to kill that dragon. If we          succeed, I'll tell you anything you want to know.",
"How did you figure all this out?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           You should know. You got the map for me. The dragonstone you got for           Farengar, remember?",
"Right, you were at Dragonsreach when I gave it to him.²           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            So you were paying attention. I arranged to have Farengar recover            the dragonstone for me. It's what I do. I make things happen from            behind the scenes. After all, here you are.",
"The dragonstone was some kind of map?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             Yes. A map of ancient dragon burial sites. I've looked at which             ones are now empty. The pattern is pretty clear. It seems to be             spreading from the southeast, starting in the Jeralls near Riften.             The one near Kynesgrove is next if the pattern holds.",
"Dragonborn: So where are we headed?",
"Delphine: Kynesgrove. There's an ancient dragon burial mound there. If we can          get there before it happens, maybe we'll learn how to stop it.",
"Let's go kill a dragon.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I need to get into my traveling gear. Give me a minute and I'll be           ready. That's better. Let's get on the road to Kynesgrove.",
"Hold on. I'm not ready to go yet.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I can't wait around for you to make up your mind. I'll meet you at           Kynesgrove. Don't waste time getting there.",
"Dragonborn: How do I know I can trust you?",
"Delphine: If you don't trust me, you were a fool to walk in here in the first          place.",
"Dragonborn: Why did you take the horn from Ustengrav?",
"Delphine: I knew the Greybeards would send you there if they thought you were          Dragonborn. They're nothing if not predictable. When you showed up          here, I knew you were the one the Greybeards sent, and not some          Thalmor plant.",
"Dragonborn: Why are you looking for a Dragonborn?",
"Delphine: We remember what most don't -- that the Dragonborn is the ultimate          dragonslayer. You're the only one that can kill a dragon permanently          by devouring its soul. Can you do it? Can you devour a dragon's soul?",
"Yes, that's how I first learned I was Dragonborn.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Good. And you'll have a chance to prove it to me soon enough.",
"That's none of your business.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           You're wrong. It is my business. You may be the only one that can           stop these dragons. But you'll understand that soon enough.",
"Dragonborn: You said the Thalmor are after you?",
"Delphine: Yes. We're very old enemies. And if my suspicions are correct, they          might have something to do with the dragons returning. But that isn't          important right now. What is important is that you might be          Dragonborn.",
"Dragonborn: I don't need to prove anything to you. I'm done here.",
"Delphine: I shouldn't let you walk out of here, knowing what you know. But I          guess even my paranoia has its limits. You know where to find me          when you change your mind. Because you will. You have to.",
"Delphine: Orgnar, I'm traveling. You've got the inn 'til I get back.",
"Orgnar: Right. Happy trails.",
"Delphine: Kynesgrove is this way. We can travel together or split up and meet          there, your choice.",
"Delphine: I hope you're Dragonborn, I really do. But we'll find out soon          enough. We may both end up dead, but at least it gets me out of          Riverwood. I don't really think I'm cut out for the quiet life. I          doubt the Thalmor are aware of you yet. So we should be safe from          them, at least.",
"Delphine: This is a notorious bandit hideout. But it's also the shortest way          to Kynesgrove, so...we may have to kill a few bandits.",
"Delphine: We'll cross the White River and follow it to Windhelm. Then we can          swing south to Kynesgrove. There's an inn near Kynesgrove -- the          Braidwood. I hear they serve a nice dark ale. Nothing on the Sleeping          Giant, of course. I'm glad you were willing to trust me. I know it          probably wasn't the best way to introduce myself. But old habits...          you know.",
"Delphine: Wait. Something's wrong.",
"Iddri: No, you don't want to go up there! A dragon...it's attacking!",
"Where's this dragon?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        It flew over the town and landed on the old dragon burial mound.",
"Delphine: Come on. Hurry. It might be too late.",
"Alduin: Sahloknir! Ziil gro dovah ulse!",
"Delphine: Lorkhan's eyes! Look at that big bastard! Keep your head down, let's          see what it does.",
"Alduin: Sahloknir! Ziil gro dovah ulse! Slen Tiid Vo!",
"Delphine: Steady. I don't know what's happening. Let's watch and wait.]          This is worse than I thought...",
"Sahloknir: Alduin, thuri! Boaan tiid vokriiha suleysksejun kruziik?",
"Alduin: Geh, Sahloknir, kaali mir.",
"Alduin: Ful, losei Dovahkiin? Zu'u koraav nid nol dov do hi. You do not even        know our tongue, do you? Such arrogance, to dare take for yourself the        name of Dovah. Sahloknir, krii daar joorre.",
"Delphine: Look out!",
"Sahloknir: I am Sahloknir! Hear my Voice and despair!",
"Delphine: This one's mine!",
"Sahloknir: Dovahkiin, your Voice is no match for mine!",
"Delphine: I'll be damned, you did it! That was well done. Come on. I've been          wanting a closer look at one of these buggers. Wait. Something's          happening...gods above!",
"Delphine: So you really are... I...it's true, isn't it? You really are          Dragonborn. I owe you some answers, don't I? Go ahead. Whatever you          want to know. Nothing held back.",
"Who are you and what do you want with me?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I'm one of the last members of the Blades. A very long time ago,           the Blades were dragonslayers, and we served the Dragonborn, the           greatest dragonslayer. For the last two hundred years, since the           last Dragonborn emperor, the Blades have been searching for a           purpose. Now that dragons are coming back, our purpose is clear           again. We need to stop them.",
"The Blades? Who are they?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Exactly. Nobody even remembers our name these days. We used to be            known across Tamriel as the protectors of the Septim Emperors.            Those days are long gone, though. For the last two hundred years,            we've been searching for the next Dragonborn to guide and guard,            as we are sworn to do. But we never found one. Until now.",
"What's our next move?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            The first thing we need to do is figure out what's behind the            dragons. The Thalmor are our best lead. If they aren't involved,            they'll know who is.",
"Remind me...who are the Thalmor?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             The faction that rules the Aldmeri Dominion. The ones who almost             destroyed the Empire during the Great War, thirty years back.             There's no worse enemy to humankind in Tamriel. The Empire barely             survived the last war. The Thalmor don't intend to lose the next             one.",
"What makes you think the Thalmor are bringing dragons back?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             Nothing solid. Yet. But my gut tells me it can't be anybody else.             The Empire had captured Ulfric. The war was basically over. Then a             dragon attacks, Ulfric escapes, and the war is back on. And now             the dragons are attacking everywhere, indiscriminately. Skyrim is             weakened, the Empire is weakened. Who else gains from that but the             Thalmor?",
"Why are the Thalmor after you?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             Before the Great War, the Blades helped the Empire against the             Thalmor. Our Grand Master saw them as the greatest threat to             Tamriel. At the time, that was true. Maybe it still is. So we             fought them in the shadows, all across Tamriel. We thought we             were more than a match for them. We were wrong.",
"What do you know about the dragons coming back?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Not a damn thing. I was just as surprised as you to find that big           black dragon here.",
"It was the one that attacked Helgen, when Ulfric escaped from the            Imperials. |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             Interesting. Same dragon... Damn it, we're blundering around in             the dark here! We need to figure out who's behind it all!",
"Dragonborn: So, we need to find out what the Thalmor know about the dragons.            Any ideas?",
"Delphine: If we could get into the Thalmor Embassy...it's the center of their          operations in Skyrim... Problem is, that place is locked up tighter          than a miser's purse. They could teach me a few things about          paranoia...",
"Dragonborn: So how do we get into the Thalmor Embassy?",
"Delphine: I'm not sure yet. I have a few ideas, but I'll need some time to          pull things together... Meet me back in Riverwood. If I'm not back          when you get there, wait for me. I shouldn't be long. Keep an eye on          the sky. This is only going to get worse.",
"Delphine: I don't think you were followed. Come on. I have a plan.",
"Delphine: I figured out how we're going to get you into the Thalmor Embassy.",
"You're not coming?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           That would be a bad idea. I'd be too likely to attract the wrong           kind of attention. But they don't know you at all, yet.",
"That didn't take long.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I've been doing this a long time, remember? While the Thalmor's           been looking for me, I've been watching them.",
"Why not just fight our way in?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           So that's your plan, huh? Even if you could survive, by the time you           got inside, whatever documents they had would be long gone. We're           there for information, remember? Trust me, I've been doing this for           a long time. My way is better.",
"Dragonborn: So what's your plan? How do I infiltrate the Thalmor Embassy?",
"Delphine: The Thalmor ambassador, Elenwen, regularly throws parties where the          rich and connected cozy up to the Thalmor. I can get you into one of          these parties. Once you're inside the Embassy, you get away and find          Elenwen's secret files. I have a contact inside the Embassy. He's not          up for this kind of high-risk mission, but he can help you. His          name's Malborn. Wood elf, plenty of reason to hate the Thalmor. You          can trust him. I'll get word to him to meet you in Solitude, at the          Winking Skeever -- you know it? While you're doing that, I'll work on          getting you an invitation to Elenwen's little party. Meet me at the          Solitude stables after you've arranged things with Malborn. Any          questions?",
"Who's this contact of yours? You're sure I can trust him?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Don't worry about Malborn. He's not a dangerous character like you,           but he hates the Thalmor at least as much as I do. He's a wood elf           -- the Thalmor wiped out his family back in Valenwood during one of           their purges that we never hear about. Luckily they don't know who           he really is, or he wouldn't be serving drinks at the Ambassador's           parties.",
"How am I going to get into this party?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Let me handle that. You'll have a real invitation, don't worry. As           long as you can act the part of a Thalmor toady, you'll get past the           guards.",
"Once I'm inside the Embassy, then what?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           That's when the fun starts. You'll have to slip away from the party           without raising the alarm. Then you'll need to find Elenwen's office           and search her files. Malborn should be able to point you in the           right direction.",
"Dragonborn: Our mutual friend sent me.",
"Malborn: Really? You're who she picked? I hope she knows what she's doing.         Here's the deal. I can smuggle some equipment into the Embassy for         you. Don't plan on bringing anything else with you. The Thalmor take         security very seriously. Give me what you can't live without, and I'll         make sure it gets into the Embassy. The rest is up to you.",
"What kinds of things should I bring?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          You're asking me? She promised that she was sending someone who knew          what they were doing... If you actually want to get out alive, I'd          bring whatever you need to move quietly, and kill quickly.",
"Hold on, I need to get a few things ready.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I'll give you a few more minutes. I can't wait here all day. It's my          neck on the line, remember.",
"Delphine: Have you given Malborn the gear you want to smuggle into the embassy?",
"Dragonborn: Yes, Malborn's all set.",
"Delphine: Good. I have your invitation to the party. But the only way you're          going to get past the guards is if they really believe you're an          invited guest. Which means you need to look the part, and not be          armed to the teeth. Here, put this on. When you're ready, I'll keep          the rest of your gear safe until you get back. You'll only have what",
"Malborn smuggled in for you, plus whatever you can pick up inside.",
"Delphine: Hmm. I guess that will have to do. You should pass for a real guest,          at least until you open your mouth. Ready to board the carriage to          the embassy?",
"Hold on a minute.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           This is no time for cold feet. I've put everything in your hands           here, not least Malborn's life. Now do whatever it is you need to           do, and let's get going before we miss our chance!",
"Razelan: Ah! A fellow latecomer for Elenwen's little soiree. And arriving by         carriage, no less! I salute you, sir! My lateness is due more to         getting lost on the way up this gods-forsaken mountain than to any         desire to actually arrive late. I prefer to arrive early. Often the         day before the party. So as not to miss out on any of the drinking.         There's not enough drinking in the world today, wouldn't you agree?",
"Wizard: Welcome to the Thalmor Embassy. Your invitation, please.",
"Here you go. (Show invitation)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Thank you, sir. Go right in.",
"Is there a problem?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Of course not. Purely a formality. Now, I need to see your invitation.",
"Just a minute. I think I left it on the cart.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Of course. Just bring it to me when you find it.",
"Razelan: Now then. Here's my invitation, I don't have a poisoned dagger         strapped to my thigh, et cetera, et cetera.",
"Wizard: I'm just doing my duty, sir. Everything's in order. Welcome back, sir.",
"Razelan: Yes, yes. Now to find myself a drink.",
"Wizard: Go right on in. The party has already started.",
"Razelan: Inside, my friend, inside! Where only the women and drinks are cold.",
"Elenwen: Welcome. I don't believe we've met. I am Elenwen, the Thalmor         Ambassador to Skyrim. And you are...?",
"My name is (name). Pleased to meet you.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Ah yes. I remember your name from the guest list.",
"Quite a party. It's my first time, you know. Where can I get a drink?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Don't worry, my parties are always well-stocked with the finest food          and drink available in this country. But first, you were introducing          yourself.",
"You're Elenwen? I've heard so much about you!         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Have you? All good, I trust. But you have met at a disadvantage. I'm          afraid I know nothing about you...",
"Please, tell me more about yourself. What brings you to this...to         Skyrim?",
"Malborn: Madame Ambassador, I'm so sorry to interrupt...",
"Elenwen: What is it, Malborn?",
"Malborn: It's just that we've run out of the Alto wine. Do I have your         permission to uncork the Arenthia red...",
"Elenwen: Of course. I've told you before not to bother me with such trifles.",
"Malborn: Yes, Madame Ambassador.",
"Elenwen: My apologies. We'll have to get better acquainted later. Please, enjoy         yourself.",
"Malborn: You made it in. Good. As soon as you distract the guards, I'll open         this door and we can get you on your way. Let's hope we both live         through this day.",
"Ondolemar: The degeneracy of the Empire is on display here in this room.Dragonborn: What brings you to this party?Ondolemar: There are those in the Empire who would wish to evade their           obligations to help root out the Talos heresy. Fortunately, those           most opposed to the Emperor's wise policy have no branded themselves           traitors as well as heretics. I am here to remind the ruling classes           of Skyrim that their loyalty to the Emperor requires cooperation           with the Thalmor.",
"Erikur: The Great War is long past. It's time the Empire and the Aldmeri        Dominion put aside their differences. Prosperity is good for everyone.",
"What brings you to this party?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         You must be new to Skyrim, or you'd already know who I am. I have a         stake in most anything of importance in Solitude. I feel that it's         time to put aside the grievances of the past, and let peace and         prosperity flourish between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion. I         try to do my little part. Besides, just between you and me, it's         making me pots of money, hahaha.",
"You sound like quite the businessman.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Not every Nord is obsessed with strength, honor and skill at arms. A         rare few are born with a gift for making money. My investments are my         strength and my wealth is my weapon. As for honor, well, there are         some luxuries even I can't afford.",
"Maven: I don't recall seeing you at one of these before. And I know everyone       who's anyone in Skyrim.",
"Are you here on guild business?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Don't mention the Guild. In fact, it's better if you don't speak to me        at all. This is not the place.",
"Orthus: I'm ready for this party to be over.",
"What brings you to this party?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Ill luck. I'm a busy man and I don't have time for this sort of         frivolity. But at the same time, I don't dare refuse an invitation         from Elenwen.",
"You don't look happy to be here.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Is it that obvious? I should take pains to seem more happy. I wouldn't         want to upset our host. But the truth of it is, I have a mountain of         paperwork back in Windhelm and it's not getting any smaller. I just         hope this party doesn't drag on all night.",
"Jarl Idgrod: If your eyes and your ears are open and your mind is free of             judgment and expectation, you might learn much in this chamber.",
"Having a good time?             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              Fair faces and fine food are well and good, but honesty is rarely              so pleasing.",
"Do you visit the embassy often?             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              There are words spoken, and words unspoken. Beware these Thalmor,              for they are adept in both languages. For this reason, I avoid              them when I can.",
"Elenwen: I hope you're enjoying yourself.",
"Do you host these parties often?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Quite often, yes. The only thing I enjoy more than luxury is sharing          that luxury with those who can appreciate it. But I also enjoy          learning the latest gossip and hear the most intriguing rumors.",
"What does your position as Thalmor Ambassador involve?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          One of my main duties is to foster a better understanding between          the Aldmeri Dominion and the people of Skyrim. I also oversee the          activities of the Thalmor Justicars throughout Skyrim, although this          has been unfortunately disrupted by the war.",
"What's your position on the civil war?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           As long as the Empire continues to uphold its treaty obligations,           my government does not concern itself with the internal politics of           Skyrim.",
"Dragonborn: I'm ready.",
"Malborn: Of course. Let me see if we have another bottle of that. I'll be         waiting by the door for everyone to be distracted.",
"Razelan: What does a fellow need to do to get a drink around here?",
"Dragonborn: You look thirsty.",
"Razelan: My friend, you are very perceptive! I have a powerful thirst that         cannot be slaked! And none of the waiters will bring me a drink.         Elenwen must have told them to cut me off, the frigid bitch. Afraid         I'll cause another scene, I suppose...",
"Dragonborn: Here, I brought you a drink.",
"Razelan: Ah, the one generous soul among a gathering of pinch-pennies and         lick-spittles! If there's anything I can ever do for you, do not         hesitate to call upon me!",
"Thanks. I'll let you know if I need anything.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Your wish is my command! As long as it doesn't involve much physical          activity. I seem to be having trouble standing on my feet at the          moment.",
"Actually, there is something you could do for me.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Wonderful! I can begin to repay your generosity immediately. Say on,          friend.",
"Dragonborn: I need you to cause a scene. Get everyone's attention for a few            minutes.",
"Razelan: Is that all? My friend, you've come to the right person. You could         say that causing a scene is somewhat of a specialty of mine. Stand         back and behold my handiwork.",
"Razelan: Attention, everyone! Could I have your attention, please! I have an         announcement to make! I propose a toast to Elenwen! Our mistress! I         speak figuratively, of course. Nothing could be more unlikely than         someone would actually want her in their bed.",
"Razelan: Although...most of you are already in bed with her! But again...I         speak figuratively, of course! Fine, fine. Get your hands off me.         I'll be a good boy now. Wouldn't want to offend our Thalmor overlords,         would we? Someone bring me a drink, quick!",
"Erikur: Did you see that serving girl? I hear elf women are insatiable...",
"Dragonborn: Maybe I can talk to her for you. See if she's interested.",
"Erikur: Really? Yes, maybe that would be just the thing. She seemed to be        playing hard to get when I last spoke to her. Go on. See what she        says. Now you've gone and gotten my hopes up again.",
"Brelas: I hope you're enjoying yourself, sir.",
"Dragonborn: That fellow over there asked me to talk to you...",
"Brelas: Ugh. Erikur, right? He was talking to me earlier. I could tell what he        was after. I hate working these parties. Some of the guests are nice,        but there's always a few like Erikur. Please tell him to leave me        alone. Politely. I'm sure you'll have better luck getting through to        him than I would.",
"Erikur: Have you talked to Brelas yet? I'm not a patient man, you know.",
"Not yet. These things can't be rushed.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Ha. Don't toy with me. I may just have to seize my opportunity with         both hands, ha ha ha. But we'll play it your way for now.",
"Yes. She said she can sneak you up to her quarters right now.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Haha. I knew it! No woman yet born has been able to resist my charms         for long. Thank you, my friend. I owe you one.",
"Yes. She wants you to leave her alone.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         What? That little tease! Leading me on and turning cold at the last         minute. I don't think so.",
"Erikur: Hello, my dear. I got your message. Where shall we go?",
"Brelas: What? I'm sorry, sir, but you must have misunderstood. I'm not        permitted to leave the party.",
"Erikur: Oh, I don't think so. I think I understand perfectly. Don't worry, my        dear, I will make any necessary excuses to your employer.",
"Erikur: So. You think you can toy with me, is that it? No, my dear. I have my        heart set on you, and I always get what I want.",
"Brelas: I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to give you the wrong impression earlier.        I meant no disrespect.",
"Erikur: Oh, don't worry. I'll let you make it up to me. Now, where can we go        for a litle privacy, hmm?",
"Brelas: No, I'm sorry, but I can't go anywhere with you. I won't. Please, I        must get back to my duties.",
"Erikur: Don't you dare walk away from me, you slut! Do you know who I am?",
"Brelas: Please, sir, leave me alone!",
"Erikur: Now you're going to be sorry you crossed me. Elenwen! This servant girl        has been throwing herself at me in a most disgusting manner.",
"Elenwen: Is that so, Erikur? And you with such delicate sensibilities. It must         have been most upsetting.",
"Erikur: I demand that you have this wench removed from my presence at once!",
"Elenwen: Well. Whatever the truth of it, I'm sure a few words with Master         Rulindil will have a salutary effect. Take her downstairs.",
"Thalmor Guard: Yes, Madame Ambassador.",
"Brelas: No! Mistress Elenwen, it's not true! I did nothing! Sir, you must tell        her! You don't know what they'll do to me! Please!",
"Erikur: Well, I'm glad that little unpleasantness is over.",
"Dragonborn: I need your help with something.",
"Ondolemar: What is it, my friend?",
"Dragonborn: I need you to cause a scene. Get everyone's attention for a few            minutes.",
"Ondolemar: This is very irregular. I trust that whatever you're doing doesn't           compromise my position in any way?",
"Never mind.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Don't presume upon our friendship. My first loyalty is to the            Thalmor, as you well know.",
"Ondolemar: How dare you speak of the Thalmor in such a disgusting manner!",
"Razelan: What? I didn't...hmm? No listen, you must have misunderstood... I         would never openly insult your...that is to say...",
"Ondolemar: Your insults and provocations have gone far enough! I'd kill you           where you stand if I wasn't bound by my oath as an officer of the           Aldmeri Dominion.",
"Elenwen: Razalan¹. And you promised to behave yourself this time. Remove him.         He's disturbing the other guests.",
"Razelan: I protest! This is an insult to the dignity of my person! This time         I'm completely innocent!",
"Ondolemar: Forgive me, Ambassador. I allowed this...fool to provoke me. The           fault is mine. There is no need for further disruption on my           account.",
"Razelan: That is absolutely untrue! Uh, that is, yes, of course. What...I don't         understand why everyone...never mind.",
"Dragonborn: I need your help with something.",
"Orthus: Of course! I mean...assuming you don't want me to kill someone for you.        I might have to draw the line there.",
"Dragonborn: I need you to cause a scene. Get everyone's attention for a few            minutes.",
"Orthus: That's it? Sure. Shouldn't be too hard. I usually end up making a fool        out of myself without even trying. Watch this.",
"Orthus: Hey, Razelan, remember when you told me I'd never amount to anything?        Well, I don't think you should say things like that about the        Ambassador!",
"Razelan: What? I didn't...hmm? No, listen, you must have misunderstood... I         would never openly insult your...that is to say...",
"Orthus: I know you're drunk as usual, but that's no excuse for insulting our        hostess. I don't think anyone deserves that kind of abuse! I've known        plenty of elves who were perfectly decent people.",
"Elenwen: Razelan. And you promised to behave yourself this time. Remove him.         He's disturbing the other guests.",
"Thalmor Guard: Yes, Madame Ambassador.",
"Razelan: I protest! This is an insult to the dignity of my person! This time         I'm completely innocent!",
"Orthus: I'm sorry, Ambassador. I didn't mean to cause such a commotion. There's        no need to have him thrown out on my account.",
"Razelan: Absolutely not! I protest...uh, that is, yes, of course. I still don't         understand what just...oh never mind.",
"Jarl Idgrod: Now here is a face I did not expect to see. Be mindful, for you             walk among adders.",
"Dragonborn: I need your help with something.",
"Jarl Idgrod: My ears are always open to a friend's request",
"Dragonborn: I need you to cause a scene. Get everyone's attention for a few            minutes.",
"Jarl Idgrod: Nothing would please me more. I'll keep their eyes away while you             do what you came here for. An old woman can get away with almost             anything.",
"Jarl Idgrod: No harm is meant to you, happy fool.",
"Jarl Idgrod: Right here! I see it in your face! The snakes writhe behind your             eyes! Get away, get away from me!",
"Razelan: Hmm? Did you say snakes? Where? I hate them, always slithering they¹         way they do...what? Are they on me?",
"Jarl Idgrod: Begone, serpent! Begone from this house and trouble it no more!             Beware of the serpent in your midst! Beware, oh people of Skyrim!",
"Elenwen: Razelan. And you promised to behave yourself this time. Remove him.         He's disturbing the other guests.",
"Guard: Yes, Madame Ambassador!",
"Razelan: I protest! This is an insult to the dignity of my person! This time         I'm completely innocent!",
"Jarl Idgrod: Dear me. All this trouble over me? I think I was confused. There's             no harm in him. Please, let him go.",
"Razelan: That is absolutely untrue! Uh, that is, yes, of course. What...I don't         understand why everyone...never mind.",
"Malborn: Let's go, let's go! Before anyone notices us.",
"Malborn: So far, so good. Let's hope nobody saw us slip out. We need to pass         through the kitchen. Your gear is hidden in the larder. Just stay         close and let me do any talking, got it? Follow me.",
"Tsavanni: Who comes, Malborn? You know I don't like strange smells in my          kitchen.",
"Malborn: A guest, feeling ill. Leave the poor wretch be.",
"Tsavanni: A guest? In the kitchens? You know this is against the rules...",
"Malborn: Rules, is it, Tsavanni? I didn't realize that eating Moon Sugar was         permitted. Perhaps I should ask the Ambassador...",
"Tsavanni: Tss! Get out of here. I saw nothing.",
"Malborn: Your gear is in that chest. I'll lock the door behind you. Don't         screw this up. Good luck.",
"Soldier 1: Did you see those robes march in this morning? Who're they with?           More of the Emissary's treaty enforcers?",
"Soldier 2: No. They're high mages, just in from Alinor. I guess Herself is           finally getting worried about all the dragon attacks.",
"Soldier 1: Ah, good. I've been wondering how we were supposed to defend this           place from a dragon.",
"Soldier 2: If a dragon does show up, maybe we'll get lucky and it will eat the           mages first. Might give us enough time to kill it.",
"Soldier 1: Ha! I'd like to see those arrogant bastards taken down a notch.           Always looking down their noses at us lowly footsloggers.",
"Soldier 2: Well, we'd better get back to our rounds.",
"Wizard: Why aren't you at your post, Justiciar?",
"Emissary Elenwen was asking for you inside. (Persuade)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • Why didn't you say so? Take over my post. Make sure nobody enters           the Solar.",
"Yes sir. Sorry, sir.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Well? Get out of here and mind your rounds.",
"Gissur: But, I need that money! I earned it. I have my own expenses you know...",
"Rulindil: Silence! Do not presume, Gissur. You are most useful, but do not          presume. We have other informants who are less...offensive.",
"Gissur: But no one else has brought you such valuable information, have they?        Etienne, he's talked, hasn't he? He knows where that old man is you're        looking for, he told me himself.",
"Rulindil: You'll get the rest of your money when we confirm his story. As          agreed.",
"Gissur: So he has talked! I knew it!",
"Rulindil: Everyone talks, in the end. Now, I have work to do. Leave me to it,          if you ever want to see the rest of your payment.",
"Gissur: Can I...I could help you. He'd talk to me. He trusts me.",
"Rulindil: You'd like to come downstairs with me, is that it, Gissur? Shall we          loose his bonds and put you in a cell together? You can ask him          anything you like, and see how he answers.",
"Gissur: No, no. I'll...I'll wait outside.",
"Rulindil: That would probably be best. Now get out!",
"Etienne: Stop. Please. I don't know anything else. Don't you think I'd have         told you already?",
"Soldier: Silence. You know the rules. Do not speak unless spoken to. Master         Rulindil will ask the questions.",
"Rulindil: Let's begin again.",
"Etienne: No... for pity's sake... I've already told you everything...",
"Rulindil: You know the rules.",
"Etienne: Noooooo!!!",
"Rulindil: Start at the beginning, as usual. If you persist in this          stubbornness I'll have...",
"Etienne: No, wait! I was just... catching my breath... why wouldn't I tell you         again? I don't even know anything... There's an old man. He lives in         Riften. He could be this Esbern you're looking for, but I don't know.         He's old and seemed kind of crazy. That's all I know.",
"Rulindil: And his name is...?",
"Etienne: I don't know his name. Like I've told already a hundred- Ahhhh!",
"Rulindil: You know the rules. Just answer the questions. And where can we find          this nameless old man?",
"Etienne: Like I said, I don't know! I've seen him down in the Ratway. Maybe he         lives down there, but I don't know for sure.",
"Rulindil: That will be all for now. I must say I continue to be disappointed in          your lack of cooperation. I hope next time you will do better.",
"Etienne: What else do you want from me? I've already told you everything.         Listen, if you let me go I can take you to Riften, show you where--         Gaaaaah!!!",
"Soldier: Silence, prisoner!",
"Brelas: You've got to help me! Please!",
"Come on, you'd better get out of here. (Free her)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Oh...thank you. I don't understand what's happening. I can't stay         here. What will I do now?",
"Etienne: I told you, I don't know anything else about it.",
"No time to explain. Let's get out of here. (Free him)          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Yeah, sure, okay. Come on, this way. I've seen the guards use it to           get rid of bodies. It must lead somewhere.",
"Sounds good. I'll follow you.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Whatever you want. But let's go, now.",
"You go ahead. I'm not done here.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            • I guess you know what you're doing. I've got to find a way out of              here.",
"Who are you? What are you doing here?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            • Hey, haven't I seen you around the Flagon? I never expected to              see another Guild brother down here. They grabbed me in the              Ratway. The nerve of these bastards...they need to be taught a              lesson.",
"Hold on. You may know something important.²           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            I damn well hope so. If it helps you twist them up, I'm glad to            help. They're after some old guy named Esbern. Something to do with            dragons, I gathered from listening to them talk when they thought I            was out. I've seen a guy in Riften who they seem to think is him.            Not much to go on -- I don't even know where he lives, or his name.            But they seemed pretty excited about it. That's it. Now, let's get            out of here.",
"You've been very cooperative. Thanks.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Why don't you just kill me already.",
"Soldier: Listen up, spy. You're trapped in here, and we have your accomplice.         Surrender immediately or you both die.",
"Malborn: Never mind, I'm dead already--",
"Soldier: Silence, traitor! Move. Slowly.",
"Malborn: Help! I'm being attacked!",
"Malborn: Now the Thalmor will be hunting me for the rest of my life. I hope it         was worth it.",
"Etienne: I saw guards dragging bodies over here. Might be a way out.",
"Etienne: You didn't have to help me, so...thanks.",
"Brelas: I don't know where to go. Somewhere far away from here.",
"Delphine: You made it out alive, at least. Your gear's safe in my room, as          promised. Did you learn anything useful?",
"Dragonborn: The Thalmor know nothing about the dragons.",
"Delphine: Really? That seems hard to believe. You're sure about that?",
"Why'd you send me in if you weren't going to believe me?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           You're right, you're right. I just...I was sure it must have been           them. If not the Thalmor, who? Or...what?",
"Yes, I'm sure. They're looking for someone called Esbern.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Esbern? He's alive? I thought the Thalmor must have got him years           ago. That crazy old man... Figures the Thalmor would be on his           trail, though, if they were trying to figure out what's going on           with the dragons.",
"Dragonborn: What would the Thalmor want with Esbern?",
"Delphine: You mean, aside from wanting to kill every Blade they can get their          hands on? Esbern was one of the Blades archivists, back before the          Thalmor smashed us in the Great War. He knew everything about the          ancient dragonlore of the Blades. Obsessed with it, really. Nobody          paid much attention back then. I guess he wasn't as crazy as we all          thought.",
"So the Thalmor think the Blades know about the dragons...          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Ironic, right? The old enemies assume that every calamity must be a           plot by the other side... Even so, we've got to find Esbern before           they do. He'll know how to stop the dragons if anybody does. Do           they know where he is?",
"They seem to think he's hiding out in Riften.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Riften, eh? Probably down in the Ratway, then. It's where I'd go.           You'd better get to Riften.",
"Oh, and when you find Esbern...if you think I'm paranoid...you may           have some trouble getting him to trust you. Just ask him where he           was on the 30th of Frostfall. He'll know what it means.",
"Dragonborn: Know of any old guy hiding out in Riften, name of Esbern?",
"Vekel: Lot of people looking for him. Don't know his name, but he's paid good       money for nobody to know he's down here. He's holed up in the Ratway       Warrens. Hardly ever leaves the place -- has someone bring him food and       such. Crazy old coot, from what I've heard. For that to stand out down       here, he must really be off his nut.",
"Dragonborn: Who else is looking for Esbern?",
"Vekel: Dangerous-looking elves who didn't give their names. Draw your own       conclusions.",
"Dragonborn: I'm looking for an old guy, hiding out somewhere in Riften.",
"Vekel: Huh. Lot of old guys around. I don't really know how I can help.",
"Maybe this will help your memory. (### gold)       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        • Well...when you put it that way, I think I do know the old guy you're          talking about.        • Big talk for someone with a light purse.",
"Are you going to tell me, or am I going to have to beat it out of you?       (Brawl) |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        • There's no need for that. Not like he's a friend of mine or anything.          Just calm down.",
"You're tougher than you look. You got me, fair and square.",
"Now where's Esbern?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         ---",
"He's holed up in the Ratway Warrens. Hardly ever leaves the place --       has someone bring him food and such. Crazy old coot, from what I've       heard. For that to stand out down here, he must really be off his nut.",
"Dragonborn: That old guy hiding out down here... Where does he live?",
"Vekel: He's holed up in the Ratway Warrens. Be careful. You're not the only       one looking for him.",
"Dragonborn: I'm looking for an old guy, hiding out somewhere in Riften.",
"Dirge: That's interesting. Why do I care? You want a drink, or maybe just a       few broken bones?",
"Maybe this will help your memory. (### gold)       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        • You know what? I think I do know the guy you're talking about.        • Maybe it would. If you had it.",
"He lives somewhere in the Ratway Warrens. Must be crazy or desperate to       live down there. Maybe both.",
"Dragonborn: That old guy hiding out down here... Where does he live?",
"Dirge: Down in the Ratway Warrens. Nice place, if you don't mind the strench,       the rats, and assorted lowlifes as neighbors.",
"Brynjolf: Never done an honest day's work in your life for all that coin you're          carrying, eh, lad?",
"Dragonborn: Actually, I'm looking for this old guy hiding out in Riften.",
"Brynjolf: Expecting free information, eh? Help me deal with business first,          then we'll see how I can help you. Besides, you look like your          pockets are a little light on coin, am I right?",
"Let me find him first. Dragons are bad for business. (Persuade)          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           • Aye, you've got a point there.           • Passing on a golden opportunity is worse.",
"Hold on -- I just wanted some information.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           And I'm busy. You help me out, and I'll help you out. That's just           how it is.",
"Yeah. I bet I know your guy. He's hiding out in the Ratway Warrens.          Paying us good coin for nobody to know about it.",
"Gissur: He's in the Flagon right now. Get ready.",
"Thalmor Wizard: You're sure?",
"Gissur: Of course I'm sure! He was asking about Esbern.",
"Thalmor Wizard: Doesn't matter. We'll kill them either way.",
"Soldier: There's the Blades agent! Kill him!",
"Esbern: Go away!",
"Dragonborn: Esbern? Open the door. I'm a friend.",
"Esbern: What?! No, that's not me. I'm not Esbern. I don't know what you're        talking about.",
"It's okay. Delphine sent me.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Delphine? How do you...so you've finally found her, and she led you         to me. And here I am, caught like a rat in a trap.",
"The Thalmor have found you. You need to get out of here.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Oh, how reassuring! Most likely you're with the Thalmor and this is         just a trick to get me to open the door.",
"Delphine needs your help to stop the dragons. (Persuade)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         So Delphine keeps up the fight, after all these years. You'd better         come in and tell me how you found me and what you want.",
"There are Thalmor agents in the Ratway. Looking for you.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         And no doubt you're one of them. Leave me alone!",
"Delphine said to 'remember the 30th of Frostfall.'        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Ah. Indeed, indeed. I do remember. Delphine really is alive, then?         You'd better come in then and tell me how you found me and what you         want.",
"Esbern: This'll just take a moment... This one always sticks...there we go.        Only a couple more. There we are! Come in, come in! Make yourself at        home! That's better. Now we can talk.",
"Esbern: So, Delphine keeps up the fight, after all these years. I thought she'd        have realized it's hopeless by now. I tried to tell her, years ago...",
"The Thalmor have found you. We have to get out of here.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Yes, yes, so you said. But so what? The end is upon us. I may as well         die here as anywhere else. I'm tired of running.",
"What do you mean, 'the end is upon us'?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           (same as 'What do you mean, 'it's hopeless'?)",
"What do you mean, 'it's hopeless'?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Haven't you figured it out yet? What more needs to happen before you         all wake up and see what's going on? Alduin has returned, just like         the prophecy said! The Dragon from the dawn of time, who devours the         souls of the dead! No one can escape his hunger, here or in the         afterlife! Alduin will devour all things and the world will end.         Nothing can stop him! I tried to tell them. They wouldn't listen.         Fools. It's all come true...all I could do was watch our doom         approach...",
"Alduin... The dragon who's raising the others?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Yes! Yes! You see, you know but you refuse to understand!",
"You're talking about the literal end of the world?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Oh, yes. It's all been foretold. The end has begun. Alduin has          returned. Only a Dragonborn can stop him. But no Dragonborn has been          known for centuries. It seems that the gods have grown tired of us.          They've left us to our fate, as the plaything of Alduin the          World-Eater.",
"It's not hopeless, Esbern. I'm Dragonborn.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           What? You're...can it really be true? Dragonborn? Then...there is           hope! The gods have not abandoned us! We must...we must... We must           go, quickly now. Take me to Delphine. We have much to discuss.",
"Esbern: You...Dragonborn? Is it really true?",
"Yes. Delphine seemed to think it was important.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Important? Far more than even she realizes! If you are Dragonborn,         then... Then...there is hope after all. For so long, all I could do         was watch our doom approach, helplessly.",
"That's what everyone keeps telling me.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         {same as above, starting at 'Then...there is hope after all.'}",
"Doom? You mean the return of the dragons?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Dragons, pah. They can be killed. The Blades killed many in their          early days as dragon-slayers. No, dragons are merely the final          portent of the End of Days.",
"You're talking about...the literal end of the world?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Oh, yes! The prophecies made clear the signs that will precede the           end times. One by one, I have seen them fulfilled. Alduin has           returned, just like the prophecy said! Alduin has returned, just           like the prophecy said! The Dragon from the dawn of time, who           devours the souls of the dead! No one can escape his hunger, here           or in the afterlife! Alduin will devour all things and the world           will end. Nothing can stop him! I tried to tell them. They wouldn't           listen. Fools. It's all come true...all I could do was watch our           doom approach...",
"Alduin... The dragon who's raising the others?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Yes! Yes! You see, you know but you refuse to understand!",
"It's not hopeless, Esbern. I'm Dragonborn.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           You're right, I forget myself. I've lived without hope for so           long... The prophecies are clear. Only the Dragonborn can stop           Alduin. We must go, quickly now. Take me to Delphine. There is much           to discuss.",
"Esbern: But, give me...just a moment... I must gather a few things... I'll        need this... No, no, useless trash...where'd I put my annotated Anuad?        One moment, I know, time is of the essence, but mustn't leave secrets        behind for the Thalmor...there's one more thing I must bring... Well,        I guess that's good enough...let's be off...",
"Esbern: Delphine! I...it's good to see you. It's been...a long time.",
"Delphine: It's good to see you, too, Esbern. It's been too long, old friend.          Too long. Well, then. You made it, safe and sound. Good. Come on. I          have a place where we can talk. Orgnar, hold down the bar for a          minute, will you?",
"Orgnar: Yeah, sure.",
"Delphine: This way.",
"Delphine: Now then. I assume you know about...",
"Esbern: Oh, yes! Dragonborn! Indeed, yes. This changes everything, of course.        There's no time to lose. We must locate...let me show you. I know I        had it here, somewhere...",
"Delphine: Esbern, what...",
"Esbern: Give me...just a moment... Ah! Here it is. Come, let me show you.",
"Esbern: You see, right here. Sky Haven Temple, constructed around one of the        main Akiviri military camps in the Reach, during their conquest of        Skyrim.",
"Delphine: Do you know what he's talking about?",
"Esbern: Shh! This is where they built Alduin's Wall, to set down in stone all        their accumulated dragonlore. A hedge against the forgetfulness of        centuries. A wise and foresighted policy, in the event. Despite the        far-reaching fame of Alduin's Wall at the time -- one of the wonders        of the ancient world -- its location was lost.",
"Delphine: Esbern. What are you getting at?",
"Esbern: You mean...you don't mean to say you haven't heard of Alduin's Wall?        Either of you?",
"Delphine: Let's pretend we haven't. What's Alduin's Wall and what does it have          to do with stopping the dragons?",
"Esbern: Alduin's Wall was where the ancient Blades recorded all the knew of        Alduin and his return. Part history, part prophecy. Its location has        been lost for centuries, but I've found it again. Not lost, you see,        just forgotten. The Blades archives held so many secrets...I was only        able to save a few scraps...",
"Delphine: So you think that Alduin's Wall will tell us how to defeat Alduin?",
"Esbern: Well, yes, but...there's no guarantee, of course.",
"Delphine: Sky Haven Temple it is, then. I knew you'd have something for us,          Esbern. I know the area of the Reach that Esbern's talking about.          Near what's now known as Karthspire, the Karth River canyon. We can          meet you there, or all travel together, your call.",
"What's the best way to get there?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           From Riverwood? The road south through Falkreath is the most direct           route. Or you could catch the carriage from Whiterun to Markarth           and then approach from the west. Either way, the Reach is wild           country these days. The Forsworn are everywhere. Best be careful.",
"Let's travel there together. Are you ready to go?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Always. Let's go see if we can find this Sky Haven Temple.",
"Delphine: This is it. Orgnar, the inn is yours. I'm probably never coming back          here.",
"Orgnar: Well, now. That's something to think about.",
"Delphine: Take care of yourself, Orgnar. Goodbye.",
"Orgnar: Yeah...sure. You, too, Delphine. You be safe.",
"Esbern: Ah...the power of the dragon is yours! There can be no doubt that you        are the Dragonborn of prophecy.",
"Delphine: This looks promising.",
"Esbern: Yes. Definitely early Akiviri stonework here.",
"Delphine: We've got to get this bridge down. These pillars must have something          to do with it.",
"Esbern: Yes. These are Akiviri symbols. Let's see...you have the symbol for        'King'...and 'Warrior'...and of course the symbol for 'Dragonborn.'        That's the one that appears to have a sort of arrow shape pointing        downward at the bottom.",
"Delphine: Whatever you did, it worked. Let's see what those old Blades left          in our way.",
"Esbern: Wait.",
"Delphine: Why are you stopping?",
"Esbern: We should be careful here. See these symbols on the floor?",
"Delphine: Hmm. Esbern's right. Look like pressure plates.",
"Esbern: We'll cross once it's safe.",
"Delphine: Looks safe now. Let's move.",
"Esbern: Yes, yes! I think we must be close to the entrance.",
"Esbern: Wonderful! Remarkably well-preserved, too. Ah...here's the 'blood        seal.' Another of the lost Akiviri arts. No doubt triggered by...well,        blood. Your blood, Dragonborn.",
"Delphine: Esbern's probably right. Try using your blood on the carved seal on          the floor.",
"Esbern: Look here! You see how the ancient Blades revered Reman Cyrodiil. This        whole place appears to be a shrine to Reman. He ended the Akiviri        invasion under mysterious circumstances, you recall. After the        so-called 'battle' of Pale Pass, the Akiviri went into his service.        This was the foundation stone of the Second Empire.",
"Delphine: That's done it! Look, it's coming to life! You did it! There's the          entrance. After you, Dragonborn. You should have the honor of being          the first to set foot in Sky Haven Temple.",
"Esbern: There's no telling what we might find inside!",
"Esbern: Fascinating! Original Akiviri bas-reliefs...almost entirely intact!        Amazing...you can see how the Akiviri craftsmen were beginning to        embrace the more flowing Nordic style...",
"Delphine: We're here for Alduin's Wall, right, Esbern?",
"Esbern: Yes, of course. We'll have more time to look around later, I suppose.        Let's see what's up ahead.",
"Esbern: Shor's bones! Here it is! Alduin's Wall...so well preserved...I've        never seen a finer example of early second era Akiviri sculptural        relief...",
"Delphine: Esbern. We need information, not a lecture on art history.",
"Esbern: Yes, yes. Let's see what we have... Look, here is Alduin! This panel        goes back to the beginning of time, when Alduin and the Dragon Cult        ruled over Skyrim. Here, the humans rebel against their dragon        overlords -- the legendary Dragon War. Alduin's defeat is the        centerpiece of the Wall. You see, here he is falling from the sky. The        Nord Tongues -- masters of the Voice -- are arrayed against him.",
"Delphine: So, does it show how they defeated him? Isn't that why we're here?",
"Esbern: Patience, my dear. The Akiviri were not a straightforward people.        Everything is couched in allegory and mythic symbolism. Yes, yes. This        here, coming from the mouths of Nord heroes -- this is the Akiviri        symbol for 'Shout.' But...there's no way to know what Shout is meant.",
"Delphine: You mean they used a Shout to defeat Alduin? You're sure?",
"Esbern: Hmm? Oh, yes. Presumably something rather specific to dragons, or even        Alduin himself. Remember, this is where they recorded all they knew of        Alduin and his return.",
"Delphine: So we're looking for a Shout, then. Damn it. Have you ever heard of          such a thing? A Shout that can knock a dragon out of the sky?",
"No, I've never heard of anything like that.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I was afraid you were going to say that. I guess there's nothing           for it. We'll have to ask the Greybeards for help. I hoped to avoid           involving them in all this, but we have no other choice.",
"The Greybeards might know.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           You're probably right. I was hoping to avoid having to involve them           in all this, but it seems we have no choice.",
"What do you have against the Greybeards?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           If they had their way, you'd do nothing but sit up on their mountain           with them and talk to the sky, or whatever it is they do. The           Greybeards are so afraid of power they won't use it. Think about it.           Have they tried to stop the civil war, or done anything about           Alduin? No. And they're afraid of you, of your power. Trust me,           there's no need to be afraid. Think of Tiber Septim. Do you think           he'd have founded the Empire if he'd listened to the Greybeards?",
"The Greybeards may have a point. Power is dangerous.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Only if you don't know how to use it. All the great heroes have had            to learn to use their power. Those that shrank from their            destiny...well, you've never heard of them, have you? And there            are the villains -- those that misused their power. There's always            a choice, and there's always a risk. But if you live in fear of            what might go wrong, you'll end up doing nothing. Like the            Greybeards up on their mountain.",
"Don't worry. I'm not afraid of my own power.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Good. The Greybeards can teach you a lot, but don't let them turn            you away from your destiny. You're Dragonborn, and you're the only            one who stop Alduin. Don't forget it.",
"Esbern: Look, here. In the third panel. The prophecy that brought the Akiviri        to Tamriel in the first place, in search of the Dragonborn. Here are        the Akiviri -- the Blades -- you see their distinctive longswords. Now        they kneel, their ancient mission fulfilled, as the Last Dragonborn        contends with Alduin at the end of time. Are you paying attention,        Delphine? You might learn something of your own history.",
"Dragonborn: I'd like to learn the Shout used to defeat Alduin.",
"Arngeir: Where did you learn of that? Who have you been talking to?",
"Does it matter?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Yes. For matters of such gravity, we need to know where you stand.          Or who you stand with.",
"Who I stand with is my business.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           If you wish to stand alone, so be it. If you wish for our help,           you'll answer my question.",
"The Blades helped me find out about it.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          (same as 'I have nothing to hide...')",
"The Blades are helping me. I'm not their puppet.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          No, no, of course not. Forgive me, Dragonborn. I have been          intemperate with you. But heed my warning -- the Blades may say they          serve the Dragonborn, but they do not. They never have.",
"So can you teach me this Shout?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           (skip down to 'No. I cannot teach...' below)",
"The Blades just want to defeat Alduin. Don't you?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          What I want is irrelevant. This Shout was used once before, was it          not? And here we are again. Have you considered that Alduin was not          meant to be defeated? Those who overthrew him in ancient times only          postponed the day of reckoning, they did not stop it. If the world          is meant to end, so be it. Let it end and be reborn.",
"At least the Blades aren't keeping secrets from me.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Do not be so sure about that. Beware -- the Blades may claim to serve          the Dragonborn, but they do not. They never have. As for me, I only          kept from you what you were not yet ready to know. Are still not          ready to know, as your question reveals.",
"Dragonborn: So you won't help me?",
"Arngeir: No. Not now. Not until you return to the path of wisdom.",
"Einarth: Arngeir. Rak los Dovahkiin, Strundu'ul. Rok fen tinvak Paarthurnax.",
"Arngeir: Dragonborn...wait. Forgive me. I was...intemperate. I allowed my         emotions to cloud my judgment. Master Einarth reminded me of my duty.         The decision whether or not to help you is not mine to make.",
"Dragonborn: So, you can teach me this Shout?",
"Arngeir: No. I cannot teach it to you because I do not know it. It is called         'Dragonrend,' but its Words of Power are unknown to us. We do not         regret this loss. Dragonrend holds no place within the Way of the         Voice.",
"What's so bad about Dragonrend?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          It was created by those who had lived under the unimaginable cruelty          of Alduin's Dragon Cult. Their whole lives were consumed with hatred          for dragons, and they poured all their anger and hatred into this          Shout. When you learn a Shout, you take it into your very being. In          a sense, you become the Shout. In order to learn and use this Shout,          you will be taking this evil into yourself.",
"If the Shout is lost, how can I defeat Alduin?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Only Paarthurnax, the leader of our order, can answer that question,          if he so chooses.",
"Who is Paarthurnax?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          He is our leader. He surpasses us all in his mastery of the Way of          the Voice.",
"Why haven't I met Paarthurnax yet?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          He lives in seclusion on the very peak of the mountain. He speaks          to us only rarely, and never to outsiders. Being allowed to see him          is a great privilege.",
"Dragonborn: How do I get to the top of the mountain to see him?",
"Arngeir: Only those whose Voice is strong can find the path. We will teach you         a Shout to open the way to Paarthurnax.",
"Arngeir: The path to Paarthurnax lies through this gate. I will show you how         to open the way. Lok... Vah... Koor...",
"Arngeir: I will grant you my understanding of Clear Skies. This is your final         gift from us, Dragonborn. Use it well. Clear Skies will blow away the         mist, but only for a time. The path to Paarthurnax is perilous, not to         be embarked upon lightly. Keep moving, stay focused on your goal, and         you will reach the summit.",
"Paarthurnax: Drem Yo Lok. Greetings, wunduniik. I am Paarthurnax. Who are you?             What brings you to my strunmah...my mountain?",
"You're the master of the Greybeards?             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              They see me as master. Wuth. Onik. Old and wise. It is true I am              old...",
"Why live alone on a mountain if you love conversation?              ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯               Evenaar bahlok. There are many hungers it is better to deny than               to feed. Dreh ni nahkip. Discipline against the lesser aids in               qahnaar...denial of the greater.",
"Tell me. Why do you come here, volaan? Why do you intrude on my             meditation?",
"Dragonborn: I need to learn the Dragonrend Shout. Can you teach me?",
"Paarthurnax: Drem. Patience. There are formalities which must be observed, at             the first meeting of two of the dov. By long tradition, the elder             speaks first. Hear my Thu'um! Feel it in your bones! Match it, if             you are Dovahkiin! Yol...Toor...Shul!",
"Paarthurnax: The Word calls you. Go to it.",
"Paarthurnax: A gift, Dovahkiin. Yol. Understand Fire as the dov do.",
"Paarthurnax: Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as",
"Paarthurnax: Aaah...yes! Sossedov los mul. The dragonblood runs strong in you.             It is long since I had the pleasure of speech with one of my own             kind. So. You have made your way here, to me. No easy task for a             joor...mortal. Even for one of Dovah Sos. Dragonblood. What would             you ask of me?",
"Dragonborn: Can you teach me the Dragonrend Shout?",
"Paarthurnax: Ah. I have expected you. Prodah. You would not come all this way             for tinvaak with an old dovah. No. You seek your weapon against             Alduin.",
"How did you know I came for Dragonrend?             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              Alduin komeyt tiid. What else would you seek? Alduin and              Dovahkiin return together. But, I do not know the Thu'um you              seek. Krosis.",
"The Greybeards didn't want me to come at all.             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              Hmm. Yes. They are very protective of me. Bahlaan fahdonne. But              I do not know the Thu'um you seek. Krosis.",
"Do you know Dragonrend or not?             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              Krosis. Sorrowfully, no.",
"It cannot be known to me. Your kind -- joorre -- mortals --             created it as a weapon against the dov...the dragons. Our             hadrimme, our minds cannot even...comprehend its concepts.",
"Dragonborn: How can I learn it, then?",
"Paarthurnax: Drem. All in good time. First, a question for you. Why do you want             to learn this Thu'um?",
"That's none of your business.             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              Nid. If you wish me to answer your question, you must answer              mine.",
"The prophecy says that only the Dragonborn can stop him.              ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯               True... But qostiid -- prophecy -- tells what may be, not what               should be. Qostiid sahlo aak. Just because you can do a thing,               does not always mean you should. Do you have no better reason               for acting than destiny? Are you nothing but a plaything of               dez...of fate?",

Ro fus...maybe you only balance the forces              at work to quicken the end of this world. Even we who ride the              currents of Time cannot see past Time's end. Wuldsetiid los              tahrodiis. Those who try to hasten the end, may delay it. Those              who work to delay the end, may bring it closer.",
"But you have indulged my weakness for speech long enough. Krosis.             Now I will answer your question. Do you know why I live here, at             the peak o the Monahven -- what you name Throat of the World?",
"No. Dragons like mountains, right?             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              True. But few now remember that this was the very spot where              Alduin was defeated by the ancient Tongues. Vahrukt unslaad...              perhaps none but me now remember how he was defeated.",
"You said you were going to answer my question.             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              Drem. Patience. I am answering, in my way. This is the most              sacred mountain in Skyrim. Zok revak strunmah. The great mountain              of the world. Here the ancient Tongues, the first mortal masters              of the Voice, brought Alduin to battle and defeated him.",
"Dragonborn: Using the Dragonrend Shout, right?",
"Paarthurnax: Yes and no. Viik nuz ni kron. Alduin was not truly defeated,             either. If he was, you would not be here today, seeking to...             defeat him. The Nords of those days used the Dragonrend Shout             to cripple Alduin. But this was not enough. Ok mulaag unslaad.             It was the Kel -- the Elder Scroll. They used it to...cast him             adrift on the currents of Time.",
"An Elder Scroll? What's that?             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              Hmm. How to explain in your tongue? The dov have words for such              thing that joorre do not. It is an...artifact from outside time.              It does not exist, but it has always existed. Rah wahlaan. They              are...hmm...fragments of creation. The Kelle...Elder Scrolls, as              you name them, they have often been used for prophecy. Yes, your              prophecy comes from an Elder Scroll. But this is only a small              part of their power. Zofaas suleyk.",
"Are you saying the ancient Nords sent Alduin forward in time?             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              Not intentionally. Some hoped he would be gone forever, forever              lost. Meyye. I knew better. Tiid bo amativ. Time flows ever              onward. One day he would surface. Which is why I have lived here.              For thousands of mortal years I have waited. I knew where he              would emerge but not when.",
"Dragonborn: How does any of this help me?",
"Paarthurnax: Tiid krent. Time was...shattered here because of what the ancient             Nords did to Alduin. If you brought that Kel, that Elder Scroll             back here...to the Tiid-Ahraan, the Time-Wound... With the Elder             Scroll that was used to break Time, you may be able to...cast             yourself back. To the other end of the break. You could learn             Dragonrend from those who created it.",
"Dragonborn: Do you know where I can find an Elder Scroll?",
"Paarthurnax: Krosis. No. I know little of what has passed below in the long             years I have lived here. You are likely better informed than I.",
"Dragonborn: The Lorekeeper at the College of Winterhold might know.",
"Paarthurnax: Trust your instincts, Dovahkiin. Your blood will show you the way.",
"Dragonborn: What do I do with the Elder Scroll when I find it?",
"Paarthurnax: Return it here, to the Tiid-Ahraan. Then... Kelle vomindok.             Nothing is certain with such things. But I believe the Scroll's             bond with the Tiid-Ahraan will allow you a...a seeing, a vision             of the moment of its creation. Then you will feel -- know --             Dragonrend, in the power of its first expression. You will see             them...wuth fadonne...my friends -- Hakon, Gormlaith, Felldir.",
"Dragonborn: Hakon, Gormlaith, Felldir? Who are they?",
"Paarthurnax: The first mortals that I taught the Thu'um -- the first Tongues.             The leaders of the rebellion against Alduin. They were mighty, in             their day. Even to attempt to defeat Alduin...sahrot hunne. The             Nords have had many heroes since, but none greater.",
"Dragonborn: How could an Elder Scroll cast Alduin through time?",
"Paarthurnax: Vomindok. I do not know. Perhaps in the very doing they erased             the knowing of it from Time itself. The dov are children of             Akatosh. Thus we are specially...attuned to the flow of Time.             Perhaps also uniquely vulnerable. I warned them against such a             rash action. Even I could not foresee its consequences. Nust ni             hon. They would not listen.",
"Dragonborn: You mean you were there?",
"Paarthurnax: Yes. There were a few of us that rebelled against Alduin's thur...             his tyranny. We aided the humans in his overthrow. But they did             not trust us. Ni ov. Their inner councils were kept hidden from             us. I was far from here on the day of Alduin's downfall. But all             dov felt the...sundering of Time itself.",
"Dragonborn: What does the Dragonrend Shout actually do?",
"Paarthurnax: I cannot tell you in detail. I never heard it used. Kogaan. It was             the first Thu'um created solely by mortals. It was said to force a             dragon to experience the concept of Mortality. A truly             vonmindoraan...incomprehensible idea to the immortal dov.",
"Arngeir: So...you spoke to Paarthurnax. The dragonblood burns bright within         you. Did he tell you what you wanted to know? Did he teach you the         Dragonrend Shout?",
"Dragonborn: No, but he told me how to find out.",
"Arngeir: So be it. If he believes it is necessary for you to learn this...we         will bow to his wisdom.",
"Dragonborn: I need the Elder Scroll the ancients used. Do you know where to            find it?",
"Arngeir: We have never concerned ourselves with the Scrolls. The gods         themselves would rightly fear to tamper with such things. As for where         to find it...such blasphemies have always been the stock and trade of         the mages of Winterhold. They may be able to tell you something about         the Elder Scroll you seek.",
"Dragonborn: I'm looking for an Elder Scroll.",
"Urag: And what do you plan to do with it? Do you even know what you're asking      about, or are you just someone's errand boy?",
"Tell me more about the Elder Scrolls.      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       I knew it. Everyone comes in here, expecting my help, but they don't       even have the proper questions. An Elder Scroll is an instrument of       immense knowledge and power. To read an Elder Scroll, a person must       have the most rigorously trained mind, or else risk madness. Even so,       the Divines usually take the reader's sight as a price.",
"Who wrote the Elder Scrolls?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        It would take a month to explain to you how that very question doesn't        even make sense. The Scrolls exist here, with us, but are also beyond        and beneath. Before and after. They are bits of Divine made substance        so we could know them. Sorry. Talking about the Scrolls, you usually        end up in irritating and vague metaphors like that. Some people who        study them devoutly go mad.",
"All right. So do you have one that I could use?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Ha!",
"Of course I do. Do you have one here?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       You think even if I did have one here, I would let you see it? It would       be kept under the highest security. The greatest thief in the world       wouldn't be able to lay a finger on it.",
"What about the Dragonborn?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        What about...wait. Are you? Were you the one the Greybeards were        calling? I'll bring everything we have on them, but it's not much.",
"Do you at least have any information on them?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Of course.",
"Urag: Here you go. Try not to spill anything on them.",
"Dragonborn: This 'Ruminations' book is incomprehensible.",
"Urag: Aye, that's the work of Septimus Signus. He's the world's master on the      nature of Elder Scrolls, but...well. He's been gone for a long while.      Too long.",
"Where did he go?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Somewhere up north, in the ice fields. Said he found some old Dwemer       artifact, but...well, that was years ago. Haven't heard from him since.",
"He's dead?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Oh no. I hope not. But even I haven't seen him in years, and we were       close. Became obsessed with the Dwemer. Took off north saying he had       found some old artifact. Haven't seen him since. Somewhere in the ice       fields, if you want to try and find him.",
"Dragonborn: I have the Elder Scroll.",
"Paarthurnax: You have it. The Kel -- the Elder Scroll. Tiid kreh...qalos. Time             shudders at its touch. There is no question. You are doom-driven.             Kogaan Akatosh. The very bones of the earth are at your disposal.             Go then. Fulfill your destiny. Take the Scroll to the Time-Wound.             Do not delay. Alduin will be coming. He cannot miss the signs.",
"Hakon: Gormlaith! We're running out of time! The battle...",
"Dragon: Daar sul thur se Alduin vakrii. Today Alduin's lordship will be        restored. But I honor your courage. Krif voth ahkrin. Die now, in vain.",
"Hakon: For Skyrim!",
"Gormlaith: Hyah!",
"Gormlaith: Know that Gormlaith sent you down to your death!",
"Gormlaith: Hakon! A glorious day, is it not!",
"Hakon: Have you no thought beyond the blooding of your blade?",
"Gormlaith: What else is there?",
"Hakon: The battle below goes ill. If Alduin does not rise to our challenge, I       fear all may be lost.",
"Gormlaith: You worry too much, brother. Victory will be ours.",
"Hakon: Why does Alduin hang back? We've staked everything on this plan of       yours, old man.",
"Felldir: He will come. He canot ignore our defiance. And why should he fear         us, even now?",
"Gormlaith: We've bloodied him well. Four of his kin have fallen to my blade           alone this day.",
"Felldir: But one have yet stood against Alduin himself. Galthor, Sorri,         Birkir...",
"Gormlaith: They did not have Dragonrend. Once we bring him down, I promise I           will have his head.",
"Felldor: You do not understand. Alduin cannot be slain like a lesser dragon.         He is beyond our strength. Which is why I brought the Elder Scroll.",
"Hakon: Felldir! We agreed not to use it!",
"Felldir: I never agreed. And if you are right, I will not need it.",
"Hakon: No. We will deal with Alduin ourselves, here and now.",
"Gormlaith: We shall see soon enough. Alduin approaches!",
"Hakon: So be it.",
"Alduin: Meyye! Tahrodiis aanne! Him hinde pah liiv! Zu'u hin daan!",
"Gormlaith: Let those that watch from Sovngarde envy us this day!",
"Gormlaith/Felldir/Hakon: Joor...Zah...Frul!",
"Alduin: Nivahriin joorre! What have you done? What twisted Words have you        created?! Tahrodiis Paarthurnax! My teeth to his neck! But first...dir        ko maar. You will die in terror, knowing your final fate... To feed my        power when I come for you in Sovngarde!",
"Gormlaith: If I die today, it will not be in terror. You feel fear for the           first time, worm. I see it in your eyes.",
"Felldir: Fo...Krah Diin!",
"Gormlaith: Skyrim will be free!",
"Felldir: Hold, Alduin on the Wing! Sister Hawk, grant us your sacred breath to         make this contract heard! Begone, World-Eater! By words with older         bones than your own we break your perch on this age and send you out!         You are banished! Alduin, we shout you out from all our endings unto         the last!",
"Alduin: Faal Kel...?! Niikriinne...",
"Felldir: You are banished!",
"Hakon: It worked...you did it...",
"Felldir: Yes, the World-Eater is gone...may the spirits have mercy on our         souls.",
"Alduin: Bahloki nahkip sillesejoor. My belly is full of the souls of your        fellow mortals, Dovahkiin. Die now and await your fate in Sovngarde!",
"Paarthurnax: Lost funt. You are too late, Alduin!",
"Alduin: Suleyki mulaag, Paarthurnax. My power has waxed, while yours has waned.",
"Paarthurnax: Dovahkiin! Use Dragonrend, if you know it!",
"Paarthurnax: Unslaad hakoron! Never again!",
"Alduin: You will pay for your defiance!",
"Paarthurnax: This is your chance, Dovahkiin! Strike with all your force!",
"Alduin: You may have picked up the weapons of my ancient foe, but you are not        their equal!",
"Paarthurnax: Dovahkiin, vosaraan! Use Dragonrend before Alduin consumes you!",
"Alduin: Meyz mul, Dovahkiin. You have become strong. But I am Al-du-in,        firstborn of Akatosh! Mulaagi zok lot! I cannot be slain here, by you        or anyone else! You cannot prevail against me. I will outlast you...        mortal!",
"Paarthurnax: Lot krongrah. You truly have the Voice of a dovah. Alduin's allies             will think twice after this victory.",
"It wasn't really a victory, since Alduin escaped.             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              Ni liivrah hin moro. True, this is not the final krongrah --              victory. But not even the heroes of old were able to defeat              Alduin in open battle. Alduin always was pahlok -- arrogant in              his power. Uznahgar paar. He took domination as his birthright.              This should shake the loyalty of the dov who serve him.",
"Dragonborn: The Jarl of Whiterun might not think so.",
"Paarthurnax: Hmm, yes. But your su'um is strong. I do not doubt that you can             convince him of the need.",
"Dragonsreach was built to hold a dragon?             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              Yes. This was ages ago, you understand. There were more of us              then. Before the bruniikke -- the Akaviri -- came and killed all              my zeymah. I used to visit him from time to time. Nearly crazed              by loneliness and captivity. Tiiraz sivaas. He did not even              remember his own name. I do not know how he came to be caught.              But the bronjun...the Jarl...was very proud of his pet. Paak!              The hofkahsejun has been known as Dragonsreach ever since.",
"You're the Master of the Greybeards. Do others come here to train?             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              I have taught the Way of the Voice for centuries and the Thu'um              since long before that. But no, Dovahkiin. Others do not come              here to train anymore. Saraan. You are the first in over a              hundred years. I meditate on the Rotmulaag -- the Words of Power.              I counsel in their use. It is enough for me.",
"You meditate on the words? How?              ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯               Knowing a Word of Power is to take its meaning into yourself.               Contemplate the meaning of a Rotmulaag. You will become closer               to that Word, as it fills your inner self. Will I teach you,               Dovahkiin? What Word calls you to deeper understanding? There               are three to master: Fus, Feim, and Yol.",
"Fus.               ¯¯¯¯                It is called 'Force' in your tongue. But as you push the world,                so does the world push back. Think of the way force may be                applied effortlessly. Imagine but a whisper pushing aside all                in its path. That is 'Fus.' Let its meaning fill you. Su'um                ahrk morah. You will push the world harder than it pushes back.",
"Feim.               ¯¯¯¯¯                'Fade' in your tongue. Mortals have greater affinity for this                word than the dov. Everything mortal fades away in time, but                the spirit remains. Ponder the meaning of spirit. Unslaad zii.                Where mortal flesh may wither and die, the spirit endures. That                is 'Feim.' Let that meaning fill you. Su'um ahrk morah. You                will find that your spirit will give you more strength.",
"Yol.               ¯¯¯¯                In your tongue, the Word simply means 'fire.' It is change                given form. Power at its most primal. That is the true meaning                of 'Yol.' Suleyk. Power. You have it, as do all dov. But power                is inert without action and choice. Think of this as the fire                builds in your su'um, in your breath. Su'um ahrk morah. What                will you burn? What will you spare?",
"Arngeir: Alduin...we heard the Dragonrend Shout from here...you defeated him?",
"Dragonborn: Yes, but he escaped. I need to find out where he went.",
"Arngeir: The old tales say that he is able to travel into Sovngarde to devour         the souls of the dead. But they don't say how he does this.",
"Dragonborn: One of his dragon allies could tell us...",
"Arngeir: Yes, of course! But how to force a dragon to talk to you... There is         one possibility. But...no, the Jarl would never agree.",
"Dragonborn: The Jarl? What are you talking about?",
"Arngeir: Do you know Dragonsreach? The Jarl of Whiterun's palace? Its name is         no accident. The palace was originally built to hold a captive dragon.",
"But I thought there weren't any dragons until Alduin came back.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Oh, this was back in the days of Olaf One-Eye, thousands of years          ago. In those days, dragons could still be found among the remote          mountain peaks. Before the Blades wiped them all out.",
"So if I could lure a dragon into Dragonsreach...         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          You might be able to trap him there, exactly. You'd require the          Jarl's cooperation, of course. That might not be easy to come by.          You must trust in the rightness of your cause, and the strength of          your Voice.",
"Esbern: Did you find the Elder Scroll? What happened when you took it back to        the Throat of the World?",
"Dragonborn: I defeated Alduin, but he escaped. I need to find him.",
"Esbern: He must have returned to Sovngarde to feed on the souls of the dead.        If you don't find him soon, he'll return, stronger than ever!",
"Dragonborn: I know. That's why I need to find him.",
"Esbern: Yes, yes. We must think. He must have a means of travelling to and from        Sovngarde. But no tale tells where that might be.",
"Dragonborn: His dragon allies must know where this portal is...",
"Esbern: Very true! Hmmm. I wonder...do you know the Jarl's palace in Whiterun?",
"You mean Dragonsreach?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Yes, exactly! Most people don't know that it was originally built to         hold a captive dragon -- hence its name.",
"What's the Jarl's palace have to do with this?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Well, you see, the palace -- Dragonsreach -- was originally built to         hold a captive dragon. Hence its name.",
"So if I could lure a dragon into Dragonsreach...        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         You could trap him there, exactly. Although...it might be difficult         to persuade the Jarl to allow you to use his palace as a dragon         trap... I'm sure you'll manage, though. If you can defeat the         World-Eater, surely sweet-talking the Jarl of Whiterun isn't beyond         you.",
"You've discovered...what?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         He's a dragon. Not just any dragon, but the right hand of Alduin,         responsible for many atrocities during the ancient Dragon War.",
"Turns out he's a dragon. But he helped me.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         All well and good. But did you know that he was Alduin's chief         lieutenant in ancient times? Responsible for terrible atrocities?         It's true that his crimes are long in the past, but justice does not         count the passage of years.",
"The Blades have been hunting him for centuries, but he was protected by        the Greybeards and then the Emperors. Justice demands that he die for        his crimes. Until he is dead, I'm afraid my oath as a Blade prevents        me from offering you aid and comfort.",
"Dragonborn: I need your help. I need to trap a dragon in your palace.",
"Balgruuf: I must have misheard you. I thought you asked me to help you trap a          dragon in my palace.",
"You know I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important. (Persuade)          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Of course. You already saved Whiterun from that dragon. I owe you           a great deal. But I don't understand. Why let a dragon into the           heart of my city when we've been working so hard to keep them out?",
"You heard right. It's the only way to stop the dragons.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           What you're asking for is insane. Impossible!",
"Dragonborn: The threat is worse than you know. Alduin has returned.",
"Balgruuf: Alduin? The World-Eater himself? But...how can we fight him? Doesn't          his return mean it's the end times?",
"It's only hopeless if we give up.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I didn't say anything about giving up.",
"Maybe so, but I plan to go down fighting. What about you?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Spoken like a true Nord. I'll stand beside you, Dragonborn.",
"Now, what's this nonsense about trapping a dragon in my palace?",
"Dragonborn: It's the only way to find Alduin before it's too late.",
"Balgruuf: • Then...Whiterun will stand with you, Dragonborn. We will take the            risk, whether it be in victory or defeat!",
"Balgruuf: So what's the plan, then? How do you intend to lure a dragon into          the trap?",
"Dragonborn: I don't know yet. But I know some people who can probably help.",
"Balgruuf: Oh...well, I'll leave that to you. I trust you know your business.          Probably for the best. It will give me time to see if that old trap          still works -- and break the news to the men.",
"Dragonborn: What if you didn't have to worry about an enemy attack?",
"Balgruuf: Then I would be glad to help you with your mad dragon-trapping          scheme. But getting both sides to agree to a truce will be difficult          at this point. The bitterness has gone too deep. Maybe...hmm...what          of the Greybeards? They are respected by all Nords. High Hrothgar is          neutral territory. If the Greybeards are willing to host a peace          council...then maybe Ulfric and Tullius would have to listen.",
"Dragonborn: Leave that to me. I'll talk to Arngeir about hosting a peace            council.",
"Balgruuf: Aye, Dragonborn. Maybe you can stop the dragons -- and this war into          the bargain.",
"Dragonborn: I need a way to lure a dragon to Dragonsreach. Any ideas?",
"Paarthurnax: Hmm, yes. I have been pondering on exactly that question. Lingrah             morah. I have tasted the voices of Alduin's allies on the wind.             Pogaan nahlaas, vokrii wah jun. There is one who I remember well.             Odahviing. He is the one to tell us where Alduin has gone.",
"Dragonborn: So we know his name. How does that help me get him to Dragonsreach?",
"Paarthurnax: Ah, I forget how little you know of the dov. Our names are always             made of us three Rotmulaag -- Words of Power. You see --             Paar-thur-nax -- a Thu'um -- a Shout, yes?",
"Dragonborn: Why would he come when called?",
"Paarthurnax: He is not compelled to come, but the dov are prideful by nature.",
"Few could resist such a challenge. Especially from you, Dovahkiin.             But Odahviing, he is...headstrong? Boziik. Rash. Even among the             dov, he was known for this. He will not resist the challenge of             your Voice, Dovahkiin. He will come. Now -- hear his name.             Odahviing. Taste it on the wind. Od-ah-viing. Know it in your             su'um. Od-ah-viing!",
"Dragonborn: I need a way to lure a dragon to Dragonsreach. Any ideas?",
"Esbern: Interesting problem. Hmmm. Yes. I've been poring over the records here        in Sky Haven Temple. An unguessed trove of lost lore...but the        important thing is that the Blades recorded many of the names of        dragons they slew. Cross-referencing this with Delphine's map of        dragon burial sites, and I believe I've identified one of the dragons        that Alduin has raised up.",
"Dragonborn: How does that help us?",
"Esbern: Ah, don't you see? The names of dragons are always three Words of        Power -- Shouts. By calling the dragon with the Voice, he will hear        you wherever he might be.",
"Dragonborn: Why would he come when called?",
"Esbern: He's not compelled to, but dragons are prideful by nature and loath to        refuse a challenge. Your Voice in particular is likely to intrigue this        dragon, after your victory over Alduin. I think it very likely that he        will be unable to resist investigating your call.",
"Dragonborn: So what's this dragon's name?",
"Esbern: Ah, indeed. I'm no master of the Voice like these worthy gentlemen,        but it is written here in this scroll. Od - Ah - Viing. 'Winged Snow        Hunter,' as I read it.",
"Dragonborn: Are you ready to spring the trap on the dragon?",
"Balgruuf: • We'll be ready, don't worry. You do have a plan for actually luring            a dragon into this trap, don't you?",
"Not quite yet.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Not that it's upon us, I'm rather looking forward to the challenge.           I'll be famouser than Olaf One-Eye!",
"Balgruuf: • You do have a plan for luring a dragon here, yeah?          • Go ahead and call this dragon of yours. We're ready.",
"We're ready when you are.",
"Guard: Hear that?",
"Balgruuf: Over there!",
"Guard: Shor's bones, here he comes!",
"Balgruuf: Hold your fire until he's close!",
"Odahviing: Dovahkiin! Here I am!",
"Guard: We may not be trying to kill him, but he sure seems to be trying to       kill us!",
"Balgruuf: Steady! Steady, now! Keep under cover until it's down!",
"Odahviing: Ni fas, Dovahkiin!",
"Balgruuf: Got him!",
"Odahviing: Nid!",
"Guard: I think it's holding!",
"Odahviing: Horvutah med kodnaav. Caught like a bear in a trap... Zok frini           grind ko grah drun viiki, Dovahkiin. Ah. I forget. You do not have           the dovah speech. My...eagerness to meet you in battle was my...           undoing. Dovahkiin. I salute your, hmm...low cunning in devising           such a grahmindol -- strategem. Zu'u bonaar. You went to a great           deal of trouble to put me in this...humiliating position. Hind siiv           Alduin, hmm? No doubt you want to know where to find Alduin?",
"Dragonborn: That's right. Where is he hiding?",
"Odahviing: Rinik vazah. An apt phrase. Alduin bovul. One reason I came to your           call was to test your Thu'um for myself. Many of us have begun to           question Alduin's lordship, whether his Thu'um is truly the           strongest. Among ourselves, of course. Mu ni meyye. None were yet           ready to openly defy him.",
"Dragonborn: You were telling me where to find Alduin?",
"Odahviing: Unslaad krosis. Innumerable pardons. I digress. He has travelled to           Sovngarde to regain his strength, devouring the sillesejoor...the           souls of the mortal dead. A privilege he jealously guards... His           door to Sovngarde is at Skuldafn, one of his ancient fanes high in           the eastern mountains. Mindoraan, pah ok middovahhe lahvraan til. I           surely do not need to warn you that all his remaining strength is           marshalled there. Zu'u lost ofan hin laan...now that I have answered           your question, you will allow me to go free?",
"Do you promise to serve me?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Aam? Serve you? ...no. Ni tiid. If and when you defeat Alduin, I            will reconsider.",
"Not until Alduin is defeated.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Ah. Well. Hmm...krosis. There is one...detail about Skuldafn I            neglected to mention.",
"Dragonborn: Tell me what you know, then.",
"Odahviing: Only this. You have the Thu'um of a dovah, but without the wings of           one, you will never set foot in Skuldafn. Of course...I could fly           you there. But not while imprisoned like this.",
"We seem to be at an impasse, then.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Indeed. Orin brit ro. I cannot leave here until you defeat Alduin,            which you cannot do without my help.",
"Do you expect me to take your word for that?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Ahraan. You wound me, Dovahkiin. I may not tell the whole truth,            but I am no liar. Go and see for yourself. Zu'u ni bo nol het. I            will be here...unless Alduin returns before you do.",
"Fine. I'll set you free if you promise to take me to Skuldafn.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Onikraan koraav gein miraad. It is wise to recognize when you only            have one choice. And you can trust me. Zu'u ni tahrodiis. Alduin            has proven himself unworthy to rule. I go my own way now. Free me,            and I will carry you to Skuldafn.",
"Farengar: Incredible! Uh...sir, you have no idea how long I have waited for          such an opportunity! I would be most appreciative if you would permit          me to perform some, ah, tests on you. Purely in the interests of the          advancement of knowledge.",
"Odahviing: Begone, mage. Do not test my promise to the Dovahkiin.",
"Farengar: I assure you, you will not even notice me. Most of them are hardly          painful at all on a large dragon such as yourself.",
"Irileth: Farengar, very bad idea. Even for you.",
"Farengar: Surely you wouldn't miss a fe scales...or a small amount of blood...",
"Odahviing: Joor mey! What are you doing back there? Yol...Toor...Shul!",
"Arngeir: Alduin...we heard the Dragonrend Shout from here...you defeated him?",
"Dragonborn: Yes, but he escaped. I need to find his portal to Sovngarde.",
"Arngeir: I feared as much. I thought it was him we saw flying east after your         battle.",
"Dragonborn: I need your help. I need to capture a dragon.",
"Arngeir: We are not warriors. What is overlooked in the Dragonborn is not         permitted to any other followers or the Way of the Voice.",
"Dragonborn: I'll worry about capturing a dragon. I need your help to stop the            war.",
"Arngeir: You misunderstand our authority. The Greybeards have never involved         themselves in political affairs.",
"Dragonborn: Jarl Balgruuf won't help me while the war rages.",
"Arngeir: I see. The dragon will lead you to Alduin, but without the Jarl's         help...",
"Dragonborn: Both sides respect the Greybeards. They will listen.",
"Arngeir: Paarthurnax has made the decision to help you. This is the road we         have to walk. Even the Greybeards must bend to the winds of change,         it seems. So be it. Tell Ulfric and General Tullius that the         Greybeards wish to speak to them. We will see if they still remember         us.",
"Dragonborn: Are you ready to host the peace council?",
"Arngeir: Deliver the message to the warring parties. If they will listen, I         will do what I can to bring them to terms.",
"Dragonborn: The Blades want me to kill Paarthurnax.",
"Arngeir: Now you see why I warned you against them! Bloodthirsty barbarians!",
"Dragonborn: Is it true what they said? Was he Alduin's ally?",
"Arngeir: Yes. But understand -- during the days of Alduin's rule, all dragons         were his allies. There was nothing else they could be. If not for         Paarthurnax, Alduin could not have been overthrown. It was he who         first taught men to use the Thu'um.",
"He still needs to pay for his crimes.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          The same could be said for any of us, could it not? Are you so          guiltless as to stand in judgment upon Paarthurnax? Listen to your          inner Voice before acting. Do not allow the Blades to bully you into          doing something you will later regret. After all, repentance is          something you deny to Paarthurnax by meting out your so-called          justice.",
"Don't worry, I'm not going to kill Paarthurnax.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Kynareth has placed the Voice of wisdom within you, Dragonborn. All          you need do is learn to listen to it, and your path will be clear.",
"Dragonborn: Where has Alduin gone?",
"Arngeir: The old tales say that he can travel into Sovngarde to devour the         souls of the dead. You must find out how he does this, before he         regains his strength and returns.",
"Dragonborn: I have a message from the Greybeards.",
"Tullius: The Greybeards? What do those old hermits want with me?",
"Dragonborn: They're convening a peace council at High Hrothgar.",
"Tullius: There's nothing to discuss as long as that traitor Ulfric is in arms         against his rightful Emperor.",
"Dragonborn: We need a truce until the dragon menace is dealt with.",
"Tullius: They are getting to be a problem. But I wasn't sent to Skyrim to fight         dragons. My job is to quell this rebellion, and I intend to do just         that, dragons or no dragons.",
"The dragons are a bigger problem than the Stormcloaks right now.         (Persuade) |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          • You may have a point. It's getting difficult to even move troops            around without attracting a dragon attack. By all accounts the            Stormcloaks are suffering just as badly. Even Ulfric might see            the sense of a truce under these conditions.",
"The best time to negotiate is from a position of strength.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Fair enough. We're driving the Stormcloaks back well enough at the          moment, but we're already overstretched. That's what comes from          trying to win a war with bare handful of legions. If the Emperor          would just give me the reinforcements I've requested!",
"Why won't the Emperor send more reinforcements?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Most of the Legion is tied down on the border with the Aldmeri           Dominion. The Emperor can't afford to risk weakening Cyrodiil's           defenses. From the Imperial City, our war here is just a sideshow.           An interlude before the main event against the Thalmor resumes.",
"The Empire can't afford to snub the Greybeards.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Hmm. You may have a point. I'm always surprised by how seriously the          Nords take these things.",
"Dragonborn: You'll come to the peace council, then?",
"Tullius: Yes. Yes, fine, I'll come to this Greybeard council. For all the good         it will do.",
"Dragonborn: I have a message from the Greybeards.",
"Ulfric: It's about time they turned their gaze from the heavens, back to our        bleeding homeland. What do they want?",
"Dragonborn: They want to negotiate a truce until the dragon menace is dealt            with.",
"Ulfric: I have the greatest respect for the Greybeards, of course. And the        dragon attacks are a growing plague. But the political situation is        still delicate. Not all the Jarls are fully committed to supporting me        as High King. I can't afford to appear weak. I can't agree to this        unless Tullius himself will be there.",
"Politics be damned! Alduin has returned! (Persuade)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • Alduin? The World-Eater of song and legend? If that's true...well,           it changes the situation doesn't it? Even Tullius may be forced to           talk sense in the face of such a threat.                 General Tullius has already agreed to attend.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Good. We still hold half of Skyrim despite everything the Empire could         throw at us. I doubt the Empire has the stomach for much more         bloodletting.",
"Dragonborn: So you'll come to the peace council?",
"Ulfric: Yes. I'll give Tullius one more chance to quit Skyrim with his tail        between his legs.",
"Arngeir: So, you've done it. The men of violence are gathered here, in these         halls whose very stones are dedicated to peace. I should not have         agreed to host this council. The Greybeards have no business involving         ourselves in such matters.",
"Don't worry. I'll get them to agree to peace.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Peace? I doubt it. They may put their weapons down for a moment, but          only to gather strength for the next bloodletting. They are not yet          tired of war. Far from it. Do you know the ancient Nord word for war?          'Season unending'...so it has proved.",
"This was the only way to get Balgruuf's help.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Yes, yes. Which is why I allowed this...violation of all our          traditions.",
"But regrets are pointless. Here we are. Take your seat at the council         table and let us see what wisdom we can find among these warriors of         Skyrim.",
"Elenwen: And so we meet again. But this time I know who and what you really         are.",
"Elenwen: I'll give you credit for boldness. But associating yourself with the         Blades is a choice you will come to regret.",
"Elenwen: I'm here to ensure General Tullius does not exceed his authority.",
"Elenwen: We should get started.",
"Balgruuf: If you can arrange an end to the fighting, Dragonsreach is at your          disposal.",
"Balgruuf: We should get started.",
"Tullius: Is everyone here? Let's get this started.",
"Elisif: I'm here because it's requested of me. But there's nothing to be gained        by talking to that murderer.",
"Elisif: I understand this council was your idea, Dragonborn. I'm afraid I don't        hold out much hope for success.",
"Rikke: I'm glad I finally got a chance to see this place.",
"Galmar: When has any good ever come from talking to the Empire?",
"Galmar: I don't know how you convinced Ulfric to talk to the Empire. Worse than        a waste of time, if you ask me.",
"Ulfric: I never thought I'd willingly stand in the same room with Tullius        again. At least not without a weapon in my hand.",
"Ulfric: It's good to be back at High Hrothgar after all these years.",
"Ulfric: I'd just as soon get this over with.",
"Delphine: We should get started. Alduin is only getting stronger.",
"Delphine: What are we waiting for?",
"Esbern: We must succeed here today.",
"Esbern: We must make them see their danger, Dragonborn.",
"Arngeir: Now that everyone is here, please take your seats so we can begin. I         hope that we have all come here in the spirit of...",
"Ulfric: No. You insult us by bringing her to this negotiation? Your chief        Talos-hunter?",
"Rikke: That didn't take long.",
"Galmar: Hear, hear!",
"Elenwen: I have every right to be at this negotiation. I need to ensure that         nothing is agreed to here that violates the terms of the White-Gold         Concordat.",
"Tullius: She's part of the Imperial deligation. You can't dictate who I bring         to this council.",
"Arngeir: Please. If we have to negotiate the terms of the negotiation, we will         never get anywhere. Perhaps this would be a good time to get the         Dragonborn's input on this matter.",
"Ulfric: By Ysmir's beard, the nerve of those Imperial bastards, eh? To think        that I would sit down at the same table with that...Thalmor bitch.        Either she walks or I do.",
"You're right. The Thalmor have no business here.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I'm glad we agree on this.",
"What's the harm? Besides, Tullius doesn't really want her here either.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Maybe so, but bringing her here is a deliberate provocation. Tullius         needs to know I won't be pushed around.",
"Let Tullius have his way on this. He'll have to give ground later.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Hmm. It feels like a mistake to me, but I'll bow to your judgment on          this.",
"Ulfric: But she is to observe, nothing more. We are not negotiating with her,        is that clear?",
"Elenwen: Ulfric, why so hostile? After all, it's not the Thalmor that are         burning your farms and killing your sons.",
"Rikke: She's supposed to be on our side?",
"Ulfric: You know exactly...no. Not this time.",
"Elenwen: Very well, Ulfric. Enjoy your petty victory. The Thalmor will treat         with whatever government rules Skyrim. We would not think of         interfering in your civil war.",
"Galmar: Ha! Skyrim will never bow to the Thalmor! Unlike your Imperial friends        here.",
"Rikke: You're lucky I respect the Greybeards' council, Galmar!",
"Tullius: Legate. We represent the Emperor here.",
"Rikke: Sorry, sir. It won't happen again.",
"Arngeir: Now that that's settled, may we proceed?",
"Ulfric: I have something to say first.",
"Rikke: Here we go.",
"Ulfric: The only reason I agreed to attend this council was to deal with the        dragon menace. There's nothing else to talk about, unless the Empire        is finally ready to renounce its unjust claim to rule over the free        people of Skyrim.",
"Rikke: I knew he wouldn't be able to resist.",
"Ulfric: We're here to offer a temporary truce to allow the Dragonborn here to        deal with the dragons. Nothing more. I consider even talking to the        Empire a generous gesture.",
"Tullius: Are you done? Did you just come here to make speeches? Or can we get         down to business?",
"Ulfric: Yes, let's get this over with.",
"Arngeir: Are we ready to proceed? Jarl Ulfric. General Tullius. This council         is unprecedented. We are gathered here at the Dragonborn's request. I         ask that you all respect the spirit of High Hrothgar, and do your         best to begin the process of achieving a lasting peace in Skyrim. Who         would like to open the negotiations?",
"Ulfric: Yes, let's get down to it. We want control of Markarth. That's our        price for agreeing to a truce.",
"Elisif: So that's why you're here, Ulfric? You dare to insult the Greybeards        by using this council to advance your own position?",
"Tullius: Jarl Elisif, I'll handle this.",
"Elisif: General, this is outrageous! You can't be taking this demand seriously!        I thought we were here to discuss the truce!",
"Tullius: Elisif! I said I'd handle it. Ulfric, you can't seriously expect us         to give up Markarth at the negotiating table. You hope to gain in         council what you've been unable to take in battle, is that it?",
"Arngeir: I'm sure Jarl Ulfric does not expect something for nothing.",
"Rikke: Yes, that'd be entirely out of character.",
"Arngeir: What would the Empire want in return?",
"Elisif: Wait. General, you don't intend to just hand over Markarth to that...        traitor!",
"Balgruuf: This is how the Empire repays us for our loyalty?",
"Tullius: Enough! First, let's be clear. This council wasn't my idea. I think         it's a waste of time. You are a traitor to the Empire, and deserve a         traitor's death. But I at least will negotiate in good faith. Since         we're all here at your request, I'd like to hear what you think         Markarth is worth.",
"How about Riften?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Hmm. The Rift would help secure our communications with Cyrodiil...          and threaten Ulfric's southern flank... You heard the man, Ulfric.          We've made you a fair offer. Are you serious about these talks, or          are you just here to posture?",
"Winterhold seems like a fair trade.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          In exchange for Markarth, the source of most of Skyrim's silver?          Hardly. Riften seems like a better choice to me. Well-fortified,          easily resupplied across Lake Honrich. Plus all the mead we can          drink.",
"You asked my opinion. I gave it to you.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Fair enough. I was hoping you could put aside your loyalties for           the greater good, but I see you're firmly in Ulfric's camp. Still...           Winterhold would allow us to directly threaten the rebel supply           lines out of Windhelm... Better than nothing, I suppose. But Ulfric           will need to offer a lot more if he wants me to give up Markarth           without a fight.",
"There are advantages to gaining Winterhold. (Persuade)          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           • ('Winterhold would allow...' to '...Markarth without a fight.')",
"You're right. Riften is a fair trade for Markarth.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I'm glad you agree. I was starting to wonder whose side you were           on here.",
"Ulfric: The Dragonborn has spoken, Tullius. Markarth will be ours. Now we'll        see if there's anything behind your talk of good faith.",
"Tullius: • I don't blame you, Dragonborn. You made the best of a bad           situation. But I can see now that this is not a negotiation at all.",
"Ulfric: As always, the Empire's fine words are worth nothing!",
"Ulfric: I expected better from you, Dragonborn. I came here in good faith, and        now it seems you help the Empire at every turn. As for you General        Tullius, I see now that Galmar was right. Talking to the Empire is        just as useless as ever. If you think you can hold Markarth, you're as        deluded as your Emperor when he signed away our freedom to the Thalmor.        Skyrim will never again bow to your false Empire! Let's go, Galmar. I        should have listened to you in the first place.",
"Tullius: You always were a fool, Ulfric. You're no better at diplomacy than you         are on the battlefield.",
"Esbern: Stop! Are you so blind to our danger that you can't see past your petty        disagreements? Here you sit arguing about...nothing! While the fate of        the land hangs in the balance!",
"Ulfric: Is he with you, Delphine? If so, I advise you to tell him to watch his        tongue.",
"Delphine: He is with me. And I advise you both to listen to what he has to say,          before you do anything rash.",
"Esbern: Don't you understand the danger? Don't you understand what the return        of the dragons means? Alduin has returned! The World-Eater! Even now,        he devours the souls of your fallen comrades! He grows more powerful        with every soldier slain in your pointless war! Can you not put aside        your hatred for even one moment in the face of this mortal danger?",
"Elenwen: A very pretty speech, but what does this have to do with...",
"Tullius: I don't know about the end of the world, but this dragon situation         has gotten out of hand. If this truce will help the Dragonborn put an         end to that menace, we both gain. Remember that, Ulfric. Now, back to         the matter at hand...",
"Ulfric: If he's right about Alduin...we both have just as much to lose here,        Tullius, remember that. Now, back to the matter at hand.",
"Tullius: You know as well as I do we can't hand over Markarth on these terms.",
"Galmar: Shor's bones, where will these demands end?",
"Ulfric: Out with it, then.",
"Tullius: We want compensation for the massacre at Karthwasten.",
"Rikke: You slaughtered the very people you claimed to be fighting for! True       sons of Skyrim would never do such things.",
"Galmar: Damned Imperial lies! My men would never stoop to such methods, even        in retaliation for your butchery at...",
"Ulfric: This is our homeland, Tullius. All the blood spilled in this war is on        your head.",
"Tullius: So, Dragonborn. What do you say?",
"Ulfric should compensate you for Karthwasten.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Well said. For once, you'll actually pay for your crimes.",
"Who's to say what happened at Karthwasten?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I should have known better than to expect you to give us a fair          hearing. Once again, the Empire takes the blame for the crimes of          others.",
"Tullius: You know I can't agree to these terms. The Emperor would repudiate         this treaty and I would be recalled.",
"Galmar: • You see what talking to them gets us?        • Damn Imperial arrogance!",
"Ulfric: Let's hear it.",
"Tullius: We want the Pale returned to Imperial control. The traitor Skald the         Elder will be replaced with a more loyal candidate.",
"Ulfric: What next, Tullius? Shall I just hand over all of Skyrim?",
"Tullius: I guess I have no choice but to let the Dragonborn decide. Although         I'm starting to doubt your fairness. So, Dragonborn. What do you say?",
"Ulfric doesn't need to give up any more territory.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          As I expected, you favor your friends.",
"Ulfric: Don't hand me a mug of sheep's piss and call it mead. These terms are        still not acceptable.",
"Tullius: I'm sure you have something in mind.",
"Galmar: Damn right we do.",
"Ulfric: You surrend Hjaalmarch to us, and take Idgrod Ravencrone with you.        Sorli the Builder will take over as Jarl of Morthal.",
"Tullius: Where do these demands stop, Ulfric? Do you expect me to surrender all         of Skyrim?",
"Ulfric: It seems I have no choice but to let the Dragonborn decide. Although        I'm starting to doubt your fairness. What say you, Dragonborn?",
"The Empire doesn't need to give up any more territory.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Even the Dragonborn betrays Skyrim.",
"Ulfric: These terms are not acceptable. You know that.",
"Tullius: I'm listening.",
"Galmar: Don't play dumb, Tullius!",
"Ulfric: Bah! This is a waste of time. I can see that we won't get better terms        from this council. So bet it. The sons of Skyrim at least put the        greater good above our own interests.",
"Tullius: Don't hand me a mug of sheep's piss and call it Colovian brandy. These         terms are still not acceptable.",
"Ulfric: I'm listening.",
"Tullius: Never mind. I can see that these are the best terms we'll get from         this council. So be it. The Empire at least puts the greater good         above our own interests.",
"Ulfric: I suppose that's the fairest deal we're likely to get.",
"Arngeir: It seems we may have an agreement. Jarl Ulfric... General Tullius...         These are the terms currently on the table.",
"You both agree to this?",
"Ulfric: • The sons of Skyrim will live up to their agreements. As long as the          Imperials hold to theirs. What about you, Elisif? Are these terms to          your liking? Speak up. I'm sure General Tullius is waiting to do your          bidding.",
"Elisif: I have nothing to say to that murderer. General, you've proven yourself        a good friend to Skyrim. I continue to trust that you will do your        utmost to safeguard our interests.",
"Tullius: Thank you, Jarl Elisif. I appreciate your loyalty.",
"After that, Ulfric...there will be a reckoning. Count on it.",
"Ulfric: Come on, Galmar. We've have a lot of work to do.",
"Balgruuf: Giving up Markarth is a heavy price for this truce, Dragonborn. I          hope it was worth it.",
"Arngeir: Jarl Balgruuf, I assume you are familiar with the Dragonborn's plan?",
"Balgruuf: Yes, I'm ready to do my part. Just say the word, and my men will          help you spring this trap.",
"Arngeir: But the difficulty remains -- how to lure a dragon to Dragonsreach at         all?",
"Tullius: Well, that's an excellent question. You haven't overlooked that little         detail, did you?",
"Esbern: Ah. I believe I can be of help here. I anticipated this problem. While        you were arranging this meeting, I was busy in the library of Sky        Haven Temple. An unguessed trove of lost lore...but the important thing        is that the Blades recorded many of the names of dragons they slew.        Cross-referencing this with Delphine's map of dragon burial sites, and        I believe I've identified one of the dragons that Alduin has raised up.",
"Dragonborn: How does that help us?",
"Esbern: Ah, don't you see? The names of dragons are always three Words of        Power -- Shouts. By calling the dragon with the Voice, he will hear        you wherever he might be.",
"Dragonborn: Why would he come when called?",
"Esbern: He's not compelled to, but dragons are prideful by nature and loath to        refuse a challenge. Your Voice in particular is likely to intrigue this        dragon, after your victory over Alduin. I think it very likely that he        will be unable to resist investigating your call.",
"Dragonborn: So what's this dragon's name?",
"Esbern: Ah, indeed. I'm no master of the Voice like these worthy gentlemen,        but it is written here in this scroll. Od - Ah - Viing. 'Winged Snow        Hunter,' as I read it.",
"Arngeir: You did well here today. I don't think the truce will last long, but         that will not be on your account.",
"Rikke: I hope this truce gives you what you need. It won't last.",
"Rikke: I'd give a week's pay to see the look on Ulfric's face again, when he       had to swallow the terms of the truce.",
"Elisif: I don't know why you gave Ulfric so much. That murderer will never rule        Skyrim.",
"Elisif: I'm glad you were able to negotiate a truce, but I still don't trust        Ulfric. He'll break his word as soon as it suits him.",
"Tullius: You'd better be able to deliver, Dragonborn. I sacrified a lot here         today.",
"Tullius: That could have gone worse. Now it's up to you to deliver.",
"Elenwen: These terms are satisfactory to my government. The truce is unlikely         to last long in any case.",
"Balgruuf: As soon as I get back to Whiterun, I'll get my men ready.",
"Ulfric: I sacrificed a lot here today for this plan of yours.",
"Ulfric: We're counting on you to make this all worthwhile.",
"Galmar: I don't much like this truce. Feels like a betrayal to me.",
"Galmar: The look on Tullius's face while the Greybeard read the terms was worth        the trip.",
"Dragonborn: The Blades say you have to die.",
"Paarthurnax: The Blades are wise not to trust me. Onikaan ni ov. I would not             trust another dovah.",
"Dragonborn: Why shouldn't they trust you?",
"Paarthurnax: Dov wahlaan fah rel. We were made to dominate. The will to power             is in our blood. You feel it in yourself, do you not? I can be             trusted. I know this. But they do not. Onikaan ni ov dovah. It is             always wise to mistrust a dovah. I have overcome my nature only             through meditation and long study of the Way of the Voice. No day             goes by where I am not tempted to return to my inborn nature. Zin             krif horvut se suleyk. What is better -- to be born good, or to             overcome your evil nature through great effort?",
"Dragonborn: It's done. Paarthurnax is dead.",
"Delphine: I knew we could count on you! Glad to have you back on our side.",
"Arngeir: This is how you repay our trust? Paarthurnax's trust? His noble         spirit...the wisdom of ages...his deep understanding of our         existence...all gone, and for what? A mindless vendetta urged on you         by a cabal of Akaviri barbarians! Begone, before even my philosophy         is tested beyond the breaking point. We are men of peace, and you are         not.",
"Arngeir: We have nothing to say to each other. Paarthurnax's murder is beyond         my powers of forgiveness.",
"Dragonborn: Open the trap.",
"Guard: You sure about that? You want to let that dragon loose after all the       trouble to catch it there?",
"Yes, I'm sure.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Your funeral. Someone else is going to have to help you get him back        in there again.",
"Hold on. Not yet.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Hey, when you make up your mind, let me know. I'll be here.",
"Guard: Get ready to open the trap! This seems like a really bad idea to me.",
"Balgruuf: Carry on, soldier. This is all part of the Dragonborn's plan.",
"Irileth: By all the gods...",
"Odahviing: Faas nu, zint dein ruthi ahst vaal.",
"Odahviing: Saraan uth -- I await your command, as promised. Are you ready to           see the world as only a dovah can?",
"Hold on. I'm not quite ready.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Kreh zini! The freedom of the sky beckons! Yet I stay here, nau            gol, as promised.",
"Irileth: You are either the bravest person I've ever met, or the biggest fool.",
"Balgruff: May Kynareth guard you while you pass through her realm!",
"Odahviing: This is far as I can take you. Krif voth ahkrin. I will look for           your return, or Alduin's.",
"Dragons: Skuldafn fen kos dinok.",
"Stormcloak: Turn back, traveler! Terror awaits within this mist. Many have            braved the shadowed vale but vain is all courage against the peril            that guards the way.",
"Who are you?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             Near Giants' Gap, in the gloom before dawn, we marched,              unsuspecting into the Imperials' trap. Then we stood and fought,             our shield-wall defending until by dawn's light the Legion's             ranks wavered. But I never knew if nights-end brought victory --             a swift-flying arrow to Sovngarde carried me.",
"What's this mist?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             I do not know -- but none have passed through. Alduin, his hunger             insatiable, hunts the lost souls snared within this shadowed             valley. Can you lead the way to where Shor's hall waits, beckoning             us on to welcome long sought?",
"Yes, it's at the far end of the valley from here.             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              (skip to 'I saw it fair...')",
"Shor's hall? What's that?             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              Don't you know? What drew you here? Surely your dreams showed              you the way? The Hall of Valor, where heroes wait to follow Shor              to the final battle.",
"Follow me. I'll lead you through this mist.             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              I'll try to hold to your hopeful purpose. Quickly, before this              encompassing fog once more snares me in the World-Eater's net.",
"Don't worry, I'm here to kill Alduin.             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              Beware! The World-Eater waits within the mist!",
"Kodlak: When I woke from cold death, my doom was lifted -- there was Shor's        Hall, my heart's desire. But now I wander, weary and lost. Alduin        hunts me as we once hunted our prey -- a bitter payment for many bloody        deeds.",
"Torygg: When Ulfric Stormcloak, with savage Shout, sent me here, my sole        regret was fair Elisif, left forlorn and weeping. I faced him        fearlessly -- my fate inescapable -- yet, my honor is unstained -- can        Ulfric say the same?",
"Ulfric: Skyrim was betrayed, the blood of her sons spilled in doomed struggle        against fate. And so in death, too late, I learn the truth - fed by        war, so waxed the power of Alduin, World-Eater -- wisdom now useless.        By gods' jest in this grim mist together snared, Stormcloak and        Imperial, we wander hopeless, waiting for succor.",
"Galmar: Dragonborn, even in death you dog my steps? How come you here? The        king of this realm will cast you out -- cursed be your name by all        sons of Skyrim, with scorn unceasing.",
"Rikke: The bitter war of the world beyond was all for naught. We are all       trapped in Alduin's web -- for our allegiance he cares not, but devours       us equally -- doom unescapable. Shor as well -- he welcomes all heroes       to his kingly hall, if we could but reach it.",
"Tsun: What brings you here, wayfarer grim, to wonder here, in Sovngarde,      souls-end, Shor's gift to the honored dead?",
"Who are you?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       I am Tsun, shield-thane to Shor. The Whalebone Bridge he bade me guard       and winnow all the souls whose heroic end sent them here, to Shor's       lofty hall where welcomed, well-earned, awaits those I judge fit to join       that fellowship of honor.",
"By the right of birth. I am Dragonborn.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Ah! It's been too long since last I faced a doom-driven hero of the        dragon blood.",
"By right of glory. I lead the Companions of Jorrvaskr.²       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        I welcome the chance to challenge the blade of Ysgramor's heir, honored        shield-brother to Kodlak Whitemane, whom I've watched for in vain.",
"By right of Cleverness. I am Master of the College of Winterhold.²       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Well met, mage of Skyrim. The Nords may have forgotten their        forefathers' respect for the Clever Craft, but your comrades throng        this hall. Here in Shor's house we honor it still.",
"By right of blood. I Listen for the Night Mother.²       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        You trespass here, shadow-walker. Shor does not know you. Perhaps        before the end you will earn the right to pass this way. Welcome I do        not offer, but your errand I will not hinder, if my wrath you can        withstand.",
"By right of plunder. I am a Nightingale of Nocturnal.²       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Do not mistake the night-shrouded thief's stealthily-taken spoils,",
"Dragonborn: Can I enter the Hall of Valor?",
"Tsun: Living or dead, by decree of Shor, none may pass this perilous bridge      'til I judge them worthy by the warrior's test.",
"Tsun: You fought well. I find you worthy. It is long since one of the living      has entered here. May Shor's favor follow you and your errand.",
"Ysgramor: Welcome, Dragonborn! Our door has stood empty since Alduin first set          his soul-snare here. By Shor's command we sheathed our blades and          ventured not the vale's dark mist. But three await your word to          loose their fury upon the perilous foe. Gormlaith the fearless,          glad-hearted in battle; Hakon the valiant, heavy-handed warrior;          Felldir the Old, far-seeing and grim.",
"Gormlaith: At long last! Alduin's doom is now ours to seal -- just speak the           word and with high hearts we'll hasten forth to smite the worm           wherever he lurks.",
"Felldir: Hold, comrades -- let us counsel take before battle is blindly joined.         Alduin's mist is more than a snare -- its shadowy gloom is his shield         and cloak. But with four Voices joined, our valor combined, we can         blast the mist and bring him to battle.",
"Hakon: Felldir speaks wisdom -- the World-Eater, coward, fears you, Dragonborn.       We must drive away his mist, Shouting together, and then unsheathe our       blades in desperate battle with our black-winged foe.",
"Gormlaith: To battle, my friends! The fields will echo with the clamor of war,           our wills undaunted.",
"Tsun: The eyes of Shor are upon you this day. Defeat Alduin, and destroy his      soul-snare.",
"Felldir: We cannot fight the foe in this mist!",
"Gormlaith: Clear Skies -- combine our Shouts!",
"Nord Heroes: Lok...Vah...Koor!",
"Alduin: Ven Mul Riik!",
"Gormlaith: Again!",
"Nord Heroes: Lok...Vah...Koor!",
"Alduin: Ven Mul Riik!",
"Hakon: Does his strength have no end? Is our struggle in vain?",
"Gormlaith: Stand fast! His strength is failing! Once more, and his might will           be broken!",
"Felldir: One more time, and the World-Eater must face us!",
"Nord Heroes: Lok...Vah...Koor!",
"Felldir: Stand together and we shall defeat him!",
"Gormlaith: No escape this time, foul worm!",
"Hakon: Stand fast! The fell worm's death is ours at last, the light returns!",
"Alduin: Nust wo ni qilaan fen kos duuan.",
"Gormlaith: For Skyrim! For Shor! For Sovngarde's freedom!",
"Hakon: Nowhere to hide! Hunter becomes our prey!",
"Alduin: You are persistent, Dovahkiin. Pruzeh ol aar. A fine slave you would        have made.",
"Alduin: Zu'u unslaad! zu'u nis oblaan!",
"Tsun: This was a mighty deed! The doom of Alduin encompassed at last, and      cleansed is Sovngarde of his evil snare. They will sing of this battle      in Shor's hall forever. But your fate lies elsewhere. When you have      completed your count of days, I may welcome you again, with glad      friendship and bid you join the blessed feasting.",
"Gormlaith: All hail the Dragonborn! Hail him with great praise!",
"Hakon: I'll look for you, friend, when at last you return to Shor's hall. The       honor will be ours when you rejoin the ranks of Sovngarde.",
"Felldir: Our ancient debt for Alduin's reprieve is now repaid -- the long night         is ended!",
"Gormlaith: Even here, where heroes throng, few can match this mighty deed.           What glory! The gods themselves must envy us this well-earned honor!",
"Kodlak: I hear your heart beat like the Harbingers of old. Your glories in        Skyrim are seen and honored.",
"Tsun: When you are ready to rejoin the living, just bid me so, and I will send      you back.",

"Alduin brought this on himself.             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              Indeed. Alduin wahlaan daanii. His doom was written when he              claimed for himself the lordship that properly belongs to               Bormahu -- our father Akatosh.",
"But I cannot celebrate his fall. Zu'u tiiraaz ahst ok mah. He was             my brother once. This world will never be the same.",
"The world is a better place without Alduin.             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯               • I am glad you believe that. At least it will continue to                 exist. Grik los lein. Even I cannot see past Time's ending to                 what comes next. Niid koraav zeim dinoksetiid. We must do the                 best we can with this world.",
"But I forget myself. Krosis. So los mid ahdon. Melancholy is an             easy trap for a dovah to fall into. You have won a mighty victory.             Sahrot krongrah -- one that will echo through all the ages of this             world for those who have eyes to see. Savor your triumph,             Dovahkiin. This is not the last of what you will write upon the             currents of Time. Goraan! I feel younger than I have in many an             age.",
"Paarthurnax: Many of the dovahhe are now scattered across Keizaal. Without             Alduin's lordship, they may yet bow to the vahzen...rightness of             my Thu'um. But willing or no, they will hear it! Fare thee well,             Dovahkiin!",
"Odahviing: Pruzah wundunne wah Wuth Gein. I wish the old one luck in his...           quest. But I doubt many will wish to exchange Alduin's lordship for           the tyranny of Paarthurnax's 'Way of the Voice'. As for myself,           you've proven your mastery twice over. Thuri, Dovahkiin. I gladly           acknowledge the power of your Thu'um. Zu'u Odahviing. Call me when           you have need, and I will come if I can.",
"Esbern: Please...Delphine has been very worried about you.",
"Delphine: We heard the news from Whiterun -- that you left the city on the          back of a dragon! That's a little...showy, even for you. Since you're          still alive, I assume you have good news to report?",
"Dragonborn: Yes, I used Alduin's portal to travel to Sovngarde. He's dead.",
"Delphine: Gods above...that's better news than I had hoped! When you walked          into my inn that day, I never imagined where it would all lead...          dragons out of legend...Sovngarde...",
"Arngeir: I can see it in your eyes -- you've seen the land of the gods and         returned. Does this mean...it is done? Is Alduin truly defeated?",
"Yes. I went to Sovngarde and killed Alduin there.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          At last. It is over. Perhaps it was all worth it, in the end.",
"As dead as I can make him.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Then it is done at last. Perhaps it was all worth it, in the end.",
"You've shown yourself mighty, both in Voice and deed. In order to         defeat Alduin, you've gained mastery of dreadful weapons. Now it is         up to you to decide what to do with your power and skill. Will you         be a hero whose name is remembered in song throughout the ages? Or         will your name be a curse to future generations? Or will your memory         fade from history, unremembered? Let the Way of the Voice be your         guide, and the path of wisdom will be clear to you. Breath and focus,         Dragonborn. Your future lies before you.",
"Faralda: Cross the bridge at your own peril! The way is dangerous, and the         gate will not open. You shall not gain entry!",
"What is this place?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Oh, forgive me. Most who arrive here do so because they have heard          of the College beforehand. This is the College of Winterhold, a safe          haven for mages in Skyrim. A place of wisdom and arcane knowledge.",
"Why are you out here?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I am here to assist those seeking the wisdom of the College. And if,          in the process, my presence helps to deter those who might seek to          do harm, so be it. The more important question is: why are you here?",
"Dragonborn: May I enter the College?",
"Faralda: Perhaps. But what is it you expect to find within?",
"It would seem that the College has what you seek. The question now is         what can you offer for the College. Not just anyone is allowed inside.         Those wishing to enter must show some degree of skill with magic. A         small test, if you will.",
"Faralda: Well done, indeed. I think you'll be a superb addition to the College.         Welcome, Apprentice.",
"Faralda: I'll lead you across the bridge. Once inside you'll want to speak with         Mirabelle Ervine, our Master Wizard. Please, follow me.",
"Dragonborn: Where do I need to go again?",
"Faralda: You'll need to speak with Mirabelle Ervine. Her quarters are in the         Hall of Countenance, but she could be anywhere on the grounds.",
"Dragonborn: Who is Mirabelle Ervine?",
"Faralda: She's the Master-Wizard here. Arch-Mage Eren may be in charge, but         Mirabelle runs the place. You'd do well to remember that.",
"Dragonborn: I'd like to know more about the College.",
"Faralda: We are the only group left in Skyrim dedicated to study of the arcane.         There are those who study, to be sure, but they do so in private, and         often in secret.",
"Dragonborn: Is there any advice you can give about Destruction spells?",
"Faralda: Certainly. Destruction spells come in different forms, each useful         for various purposes. Concentration spells can be cast immediately,         though they're weaker. Good for a tight spot, and less costly if you         miss. You'll also need to decide whether to devote yourself to a         single type of spell. Focusing solely on flame spells will make them         more powerful, but you may find yourself at a disadvantage against         foes immune to fire.",
"Mirabelle: I believe I've made myself rather clear.",
"Ancano: Yes, of course. I'm simply trying to understand the reasoning behind        the decision.",
"Mirabelle: You may be used to the Empire bowing to your every whim, but I'm           afraid you'll find the Thalmor receive no such treatment here. You           are a guest of the College, here at the pleasure of the Arch-Mage.           I hope you appreciate the opportunity.",
"Ancano: Yes, of course. The Arch-Mage has my thanks.",
"Mirabelle: Very good. Then we're done here.",
"Mirabelle: Welcome to the College.",
"Dragonborn: I was told to come see you.",
"Mirabelle: Another new student...I'm surprised at how many of you there are           lately. Well, first you'll need these. While you're not required to           wear them, you may find them more to your liking than your current           clothes. I'll give you a brief tour, and then we'll get you to your           first class. Are you ready to begin?",
"Sorry, I'm not ready for that just yet.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            I see. Well, please let me know when you are.",
"Mirabelle: The College of Winterhold has been a fixture in Skyrim for thousands           of years. The prominent feature here is the Hall of the Elements.           It's our primary location for lectures, practice sessions, and           general meetings. The Arcanaeum is located above the hall, and the           Arch-Mage's quarters above that. While technically in charge of the           College, the Arch-Mage's responsibilities often keep him occupied.           Thus, I run the day-to-day operations. Now, if you'll please follow           me, I'll show you to the living quarters. Unfortunately, we've had           to implement more stringent entry procedures, due to some problems           with the local Nords. We don't anticipate any real violence, but it           never hurts to be prepared.",
"Our newest members are housed here at the Hall of Attainment. I'll           ask that you please keep your voice down while inside, as others may           be working on research or...delicate experiments. Now, I'll show you           to your quarters. You're going to be sharing space with your fellow           Apprentices, who you'll meet shortly. This is where you'll be           staying. This bed and desk are yours. Please try and be considerate           of others. Now, let's go back to the Hall of the Elements, where           most of the members gather for lectures and study sessions.",
"Initially, you'll be learning from Tolfdir, one of our most esteemed           Wizards. Tolfdir is likely already addressing the new Apprentices.           Go on in, and if you have any problems, let one of our senior           members know.",
"Dragonborn: What's expected of me here?",
"Mirabelle: There are no expectations. The College is a place to study and           practice magic freely. Hopefully any discoveries made in your           pursuits will be shared with members of the College first. That way           we all benefit.",
"Dragonborn: Where can I learn new spells?",
"Mirabelle: Well, that depends on what you're looking for. Faralda can teach           Destruction spells, and offers training in that school. Phinis is           one of the best Conjurers in all Skyrim, and can help with spells           from that school. Don't let Tolfdir fool you; he's the pre-eminent           scholar in Alteration. One of the best in Tamriel, and always           willing to pass on his knowledge. If you can find him and focus his           attention, there's a great deal Drevis can teach you about Illusion           magic. And finally, there's Colette. She may be...difficult to get           along with, but she's very knowledgeable when it comes to           Restoration magic.",
"Tolfdir: Welcome, welcome! We were just beginning. Please, stay and listen. So,         as I was saying, the first thing to understand is that magic is, by         its very nature, volatile and dangerous. Unless you can control it, it         can and will destroy you.",
"Brelyna: Sir, I think we all understand that fairly well. We wouldn't be here         if we couldn't control magic!",
"Tolfdir: Of course, my dear. Of course. You all possess some inherent magical         ability. That much is not being questioned. What I'm talking about is         true control, mastery of magic. It takes years, if not decades, of         practice and study.",
"Tolfdir: Please, please! This is exactly what I'm talking about. Eagerness must         be tempered with caution, or else disaster is inevitable.",
"Onmund: But we've only just arrived here -- you've no idea what any of us are        capable of. Why not give us a chance to show you what we can do?",
"Tolfdir: You've been quiet so far. What do you think we should do?",
"Onmund: We're all pretty new at this, right? Let's just give it a                  chance. What's the worst that could happen?",
"Brelyna: See? He agrees with us too! Why don't you actually show us                   something?",
"Safety should be more important than anything.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Well, your classmates certainly seem to disagree with you.",
"Tolfdir: All right, let's settle down. I suppose we can try something         practical... In continuing with our theme of safety, we'll start with         Wards. Wards are protective spells that block magic. I'll teach you         all a ward, and we'll see if you can successfully use it to block         spells, all right? Would you mind helping me with the demonstration?         Are you at all familiar with ward spells?",
"Now, if you'll just stand right over there, I'll cast a spell at you,         and you block it with the ward. Here we go. Over there, please. Just         opposite me. Wouldn't want anyone else in the way. Now, cast the ward         spell, and keep it up. You'll have to keep your ward up, or else this         won't work. I don't want to hurt you. Hold still...",
"Tolfdir: Excellent work! Well, I think this is an excellent start. I'd like         you all to continue practicing with wards, please. I think perhaps         we're ready to begin exploring some of the various applications of         magic throughout history. The College has undertaken a fascinating         excavation in the ruins of Saarthal nearby. It's an excellent learning         opportunity. I suggest we meet there in a few hours, and see what         awaits us inside. That's all for now, thank you.",
"Tolfdir: And here we all are. Shall we step inside?",
"What's so important about this place?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          We're particularly interested in the prevalence of magical seals          placed on the tombs here. It's rather unlike anything we've          encountered.",
"What are we looking for?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Anything! Anything at all that might be of interest. That's why I          adore this location...we have no idea what we're going to find. And          if, along the way, my message about the dangers of magic should          happen to sink in for a few students, that would be a happy          coincidence.",
"Sorry, I'm still not ready to go in there.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Still? If I have to wait much longer, you may need to just bury me           here.",
"Tolfdir: As some of you may know, Saarthal was one of the earliest Nord         settlements in Skyrim. It was also the largest. Sacked by the Elves         in the infamous 'Night of Tears,' not much is known about what         happened to Saarthal. This is an exciting opportunity for us. To be         able to study such an early civilization, and the magics they used...         Well, are there any questions before we begin?",
"Now what?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Well, are there any questions before we begin?",
"Now, let's see. What shall we have the rest of you do? Brelyna, my         dear. Why don't you search for warding magics? Anything designed to         keep people out. Don't interact with them, just identify them. All         right, everyone. Onmund, please search that area over there. See if         you notice any...residual energies. Alive or undead. J'zargo...what         shall we have you do... Ah! Why don't you verify that we're the first         ones here? Look for any amount of tampering with the tombs. All right,         everyone. Let's be careful, but have fun!",
"Let's be careful, but have fun!",
"Brelyna: I'm not seeing any signs of warding magics at all. Either they're not         here, or they were removed long ago.",
"Brelyna: To think, my ancestors destroyed the homes of Onmund's ancestors. So         much bloodshed.",
"Onmund: Can you imagine what it was like, living here so long ago? The first        men in Tamriel, here...",
"Onmund: I wonder if everyone else would be so happy to rifle through the bones        of their ancestors.",
"Tolfdir: Please be careful here. The site isn't entirely secured.",
"Arniel: Don't touch anything!",
"Dragonborn: Tolfdir told me to help you.",
"Arniel: What? Ah, yes. You. I remember you. You're going to help? That's fine.        Just... Just don't make a mess of my work. I've only looked through a        portion of this section. You, uh, you can look around in the chambers        just north of here. Try and be careful, all right? We don't want to        damage anything.",
"Dragonborn: What did you need me to do?",
"Arniel: Just round up the rest of the magical artifacts so that I can catalog        them.",
"Tolfdir: What in the world was that racket? Is everything all right?",
"Dragonborn: I'm trapped in here!",
"Tolfdir: How in the world did that happen?",
"Dragonborn: I pulled an amulet off the wall.",
"Tolfdir: Really? Perhaps the amulet is important somehow. Is there some way you         can use it?",
"Tolfdir: Do you see that? Some kind of resonance...you and the wall. It must         be connected to the amulet! I wonder...what effect might your spells         have?",
"Dragonborn: Did you see that?",
"Tolfdir: Well would you look at that! This appears to lead somewhere. Let's         see where it goes. Well, this is highly unusual. And very interesting.         Why in the world would this be sealed off? What is this place? I'm         not sure what to expect here. Please be on your guard.",
"Nerien: Know that you have set in motion a chain of events that cannot be        stopped. Judgment has not been passed, as you had no way of knowing.        Judgment will be passed on your actions to come, and how you deal with        the dangers ahead of you. This warning is passed to you because the        Psijic Order believes in you. You, mage, and you alone, have the        potential to prevent disaster. Take great care, and know that the        Order is watching.",
"Tolfdir: I...I swear I felt something rather strange just then. What just         happened?",
"Dragonborn: Some sort of ghost or apparition appeared. It spoke to me.",
"Tolfdir: I'm afraid I didn't see anything... Can you tell me more about what         you just saw?",
"Dragonborn: It said something about danger ahead, and the Psijic Order.",
"Tolfdir: The Psijic Order? Are you quite sure about that? That's very odd. And         danger ahead? Why that doesn't make any sense at all. The Psijics have         no connection to these ruins. And no one's seen any of their order in         a long time. Perhaps we should take a look inside these coffins...         Now please do be careful. Who knows what we're going to find.",
"Dragonborn: What's the Psijic Order?",
"Tolfdir: They were a group of mages with a history that pre-dates the Empire.         Very powerful, very secretive. No one's seen them in well over a         hundred years. They vanished, along with their sanctuary on the Isle         of Artaeum. I have no idea what connection they'd have to this place.",
"Dragonborn: Why is the Psijic Order contacting me?",
"Tolfdir: I have no idea, but it's fascinating. Assuming it's true, of course.         The Isle of Artaeum disappeared over a hundred years ago, and no one         has seen them since. And yet now, suddenly, they have chosen to         contact you? Why, it's intriguing! If nothing else, I'd take it as a         compliment. The Psijics have only ever dealt with those they feel         worthy.",
"Tolfdir: I've never seen anything like this in Nordic ruins before. Why, just         look at all these coffins! This bears closer inspection. I'd like to         stay a while and examine this. You, however, should press on. See if         you can find whatever this vision of yours mentioned. But if it is         truly dangerous, be careful. Go on ahead. I'll be sure and catch up         with you before long.",
"Tolfdir: Hold on, my boy. Hold on! I thought it high time I caught up with you.",
"Tolfdir: Well now...would you look at that. I never imagined we'd find         something like this. Why is this buried so far within Saarthal?",
"Tolfdir: Nothing seems to work! Keep it busy. I'll try to drain some of its         power.",
"Jyrik Gaulderson: Qiilaan us dilon!",
"Tolfdir: I'm not the only one seeing this, am I? Why, this is utterly unique.",
"Dragonborn: What is this thing?",
"Tolfdir: I have no idea! This is amazing. Absolutely amazing. The Arch-Mage         needs to be informed immediately. He needs to see this for himself. I         don't dare leave this unattended. Can you return to the College and         inform Savos Aren of this discovery? Please, hurry.",
"Dragonborn: What should I tell the Arch-Mage?",
"Tolfdir: Let him know that we've unearthed something... Well, I'm not sure.         Something unique, let's say. It's clearly magical in nature, but like         nothing I've ever seen before. He should be most interested.",
"Dragonborn: Will you be all right by yourself?",
"Tolfdir: Oh, I think I'll be fine. We seem to have eliminated the most pressing         threat. It certainly seems that whoever placed this here intended for         it to be well guarded. I wonder why...",
"Savos: You are relatively new here, are you not? I have noticed you, but we       have not spoken.",
"No, we haven't.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Then allow me to introduce myself.",
"No, sir.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        'Sir'? How quaint.",
"Dragonborn: I need to speak to you about Saarthal.",
"Savos: Please don't tell me that another one of the apprentices has been       incinerated. I have enough to deal with right now.",
"We found some sort of...orb. Tolfdir wanted you to see it.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        I...see. I trust that Tolfdir will provide a more...specific        explanation.",
"We've found something in Saarthal, and Tolfdir thinks it's important.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Very well, I trust you wouldn't be here were it not significant.",
"Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Tolfdir normally looks       after your little group, yes? Since he's apparently occupied, and I will       need to see this discovery for myself, I think perhaps you should begin       researching the subject. Speak with Urag in the Arcanaeum. See if he is       aware of anything that matches your discovery. And...good work. The next       time you find yourself exploring Nordic ruins, perhaps this will be       helpful.",
"Dragonborn: Dangerous research must be a problem here.",
"Savos: Not often, no. Some risks must be taken, to be sure. I am simply trying       to avoid untimely deaths. We also must make an effort to avoid worsening       what Skyrim thinks of us.",
"Dragonborn: What's the purpose of the College?",
"Savos: Purpose? I should think it's self-evident. Magic is a true power, not       something to be shunned by commoners or treated as an amusing diversion       by politicians. It shapes worlds, creates and destroys life... It       deserves proper respect and study. The College is a place where we can       focus on that, without the pressures of the world weighing down on us.",
"Dragonborn: I'd like to know more about the College's history.",
"Savos: I've seen documents dating back to the late Second Era. Beyond that,       it's hard to say. Events in the last several hundred years resulted in       a significant loss of our history, I'm afraid.",
"Dragonborn: What happened in the last few hundred years?",
"Savos: The Great Collapse, as it has come to be known. An unfortunate natural       disaster that ravaged the area. The College fared far better than the       city of Winterhold, but it was not left untouched.",
"Dragonborn: What caused the Great Collapse?",
"Savos: No one is sure of the cause. Some believed the eruption of Red Mountain       had far-reaching consequences that were only felt years later. I know       there are some who have blamed the College, said that we were       responsible. I assure you this is not the case.",
"Dragonborn: Tell me more about the Great Collapse.",
"Savos: The Sea of Ghosts practically came alive. No one was expecting it.       Monstrous waves battered the shore for weeks on end. Winterhold was       ancient and weathered, but it couldn't withstand the sea's fury. Entire       districts of the city were lost overnight. The waves receded in time,       but the damage was irreversible. Most residents of Winterhold abandoned       what was left of the city. The College survived, and so here we remain.",
"Dragonborn: Have you ever met with the Psijic Order?",
"Savos: Personally? No, not I. One of their number used to advise the Arch-Mage       when I was but an Apprentice here. But that was a great many years ago,       before all the members of the order were called back to the Isle of       Artaeum, and it disappeared entirely.",
"Faralda: There you are. I've been trying to find you. I just wanted to let you         know Ancano's been asking about you. I think he's looking for you.",
"Dragonborn: Why would Ancano be looking for me?",
"Faralda: I'm not sure. Just... Well, mind what you tell him, all right?",
"Is there a problem?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          No, no. Well, I don't think so. Between the two of us, there are          rumors about him. That this 'advisor' position he has is a sham, an          excuse.",
"What does it matter what I say to him?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Between the two of us, there are rumors about him. That this          'advisor' position he has is a sham, an excuse.",
"That what he's really doing is spying for the Thalmor, trying to feed         them information. Whether it's true, I can't say. But it never hurts         to be a little suspicious, does it?",
"Thanks for the warning.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          You're welcome.",
"Urag: You are now in the Arcanaeum, of which I am in charge. It might as well      be my own little plane of Oblivion. Disrupt my Arcanaeum, and I will      have you torn apart by angry Atronachs. Now, do you require assistance?",
"Dragonborn: I need to learn about something we found in Saarthal.",
"Urag: I know what you want. Word travels fast around here. Discovered some big      mystery, huh? Well you don't even need to ask. No, I don't have anything      for you. Not anymore, anyway.",
"Dragonborn: You don't have anything that can help?",
"Urag: I said not anymore. Orthorn stole a number of books when he ran off to      Fellglow Keep to join those Summoners. Some kind of peace offering. I      think one of his volumes may have had some relevant information. If you      want them, you'll have to talk to Orthorn.",
"Dragonborn: Doesn't anyone care that Orthorn stole things from the College?",
"Urag: Not enough to bother with it. Arch-Mage Aren's approach to these things      is to just let them sort themselves out. Although now it looks like      you'll be doing the sorting. Good luck with that.",
"Dragonborn: Who is Orthorn?",
"Urag: He was an Apprentice here at the College. Not very skilled, but got      involved with a group of mages who took a liking to him. When they left,      he took off after them. Stole supplies and books from the College, I      suppose as a way to ingratiate himself.",
"Dragonborn: Why are these mages in Fellglow Keep?",
"Urag: Let's just call it a 'difference of opinion' with the College. They were      interested in research that goes outside the bounds of what the College      allows, so they were...persuaded to leave.",
"Ancano: You there. I have questions for you. You were in Saarthal, yes? It has        come to my attention that something was found there.",
"Maybe...        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I know full well that you have. Please do not insult my intelligence.         Tolfdir is still there now, is he? I shall expect a full report when         he returns.",
"Yes, we did. I just informed the Arch-Mage.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I am well aware. Tolfdir is still in Saarthal, is he? I shall be         expecting a full report from him when he returns.",
"How do you know anything about this?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         It is my job to know these things. My role as advisor to the Arch-Mage         is aided by knowing everything that transpires here.",
"Why does this matter to you?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Something was discovered in Saarthal that was significant enough that         Tolfdir sent a new member of the College, alone, to deliver word.         That sounds precisely like the sort of thing that should matter to         everyone. Especially me.",
"Thank you for your help. You may go now.",
"Dragonborn: There's a rumor that you're spying for the Thalmor.",
"Ancano: What? Preposterous, and just the sort of thing I would expect from        mages who have nothing better to do with their time. I have made it        quite clear that my only here is as advisor to the Arch-Mage. I would        suggest that you not further spread this rumor.",
"Dragonborn: What is it you do here?",
"Ancano: I am an advisor to the Arch-Mage. The Thalmor wish to promote relations        with your College. I am at the Arch-Mage's disposal if he requires        advice.",
"Dragonborn: Does the Arch-Mage often ask for advice?",
"Ancano: Perhaps not as often as he should. In time, I believe he will be more        trusting.",
"Dragonborn: I'd like to know more about the Thalmor.",
"Ancano: Now that stability has been established between the Dominion and the        Empire, we seek only to help Skyrim. To guide its people through this        time of transition, to help lead them to a better future.",
"Orthorn: Please! Help me! Don't leave me here!",
"Dragonborn: So, you're Orthorn?",
"Orthorn: Yes, yes! Did Arch-Mage Aren send you? He sent you to rescue me,         didn't he?",
"Dragonborn: Where are the books you stole?",
"Orthorn: I don't have them anymore. She took them... The Caller. She's the one         who put me in here! Please, let me out of here!",
"Dragonborn: Why are you in this cage?",
"Orthorn: They threw me in here until they were ready to use me in one of their         experiments. This wasn't supposed to happen. I thought they wanted my         help, not to use me as a test subject!",
"Dragonborn: Is there a key for this cage?",
"Orthorn: No, it's the levers in the center there. Just make sure you don't pull         the wrong one. Please, hurry. I don't like being in here!",
"Orthorn: Thank you, thank you! I promise I'll help. And then I'll go back to         the College and I'll beg them to let me back in.",
"Now where are the books?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Yes, of course. I said I'd tell you, didn't I? The Caller will have          them. She was most interested in one of the volumes. Although not          interested enough to keep me from being locked up.",
"Dragonborn: You should get yourself to safety.",
"Orthorn: Don't you need my help?",
"This will be easier without you getting in my way.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Well, I was only trying to help. Fine, I'll just save myself then.          Thank you for letting me out of that cage.",
"If you don't get away from me right now, I may kill you myself.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I was only trying to help you, you know! I hope the Caller turns          you inside out¹!",
"You're right. I could use some help.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I shall do my best.",
"The Caller: So, you're the one who barged into my home and laid waste to my            projects. How nice to meet you.",
"Who are you?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             Names no longer matter. You may refer to me as The Caller. Now,             do you have a reason for making such a mess?",
"May I please have the books?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯",
"Oh, now we're all please and thank you, are we? I'm afraid we're             well beyond pleasantries. I'll allow you the opportunity to turn             around, walk out that door, and never come back. I suggest you             move quickly.",
"Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             • I'm afraid you don't have anything worth trading. Now, you can               go back to your College and leave me be, or I can kill you. Your               choice.",
"Let me leave with the books, and there won't be any more trouble.²            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             • Fine. Take them and be gone. Never return here, or else you'll               face my full wrath.",
"Orthorn: I, uhh... Wait, what?",
"The Caller: He gets the books, I get you. It's very simple.",
"Orthorn: But why?",
"The Caller: This little adventure of yours has cost me a number of test            subjects. I need more, and you'll do nicely.",
"Orthorn: You wouldn't do that, would you? You wouldn't leave me here with her!",
"The Caller: I'm waiting. Well, what's it going to be?",
"Dragonborn: It's a deal. You can have Orthorn.",
"The Caller: Fine. Take your books and leave at once. If you ever come back, I            won't be so gracious.",
"Orthorn: How could you just leave me here?",
"Orthorn: Well, everything worked out nicely, didn't it?",
"Dragonborn: I've got what I came for.",
"Orthorn: Yes, you certainly do. You'll be going back to the College, then? I,         uhh...I think perhaps I'll wait a bit before venturing there myself.         Let this whole thing blow over, you know. Give certain parties a         chance to forget what I may have done. Still, you've gotten me out of         that cage, and I won't forget it. Thank you again, and good luck to         you.",
"Dragonborn: Here are the books that went missing.",
"Urag: Well, well. And you seem to be in one piece! Thank you. I'll look these      over, and inform Mirabelle if I find anything relevant. 'Night of Tears,'      eh? I remember this one. Well, isn't that interesting. Did you read it      yourself? If I recall correctly, that has some interesting implications.      You should mention that to Tolfdir. And...here. I suppose you've earned      these.",
"Dragonborn: Urag suggested I come see you.",
"Tolfdir: Did he now? Does he have information about our wonderful discovery?",
"There's a book he thinks you should read.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Ah, yes. I'll be sure and stop by the Arcanaeum later.",
"Tolfdir: I'm sure you've already noticed the markings. They're quite unlike         anything we've seen before. Ayleid, Dwemer, Daedric... Not even         Falmer. None of them are a match. Quite curious indeed. Now, I'm not         sure you're quite as attuned as I am, given my extensive years of         experience, but can you feel that? This marvelous object. It         practically radiates magicka, and yet it's unlike anything I've felt         before. Arch-Mage Aren is already hard at work, and hopefully we'll         have more information soon.",
"Ancano: I'm afraid I must intrude. It is urgent that I speak with your        associate immediately.",
"Tolfdir: This is most inappropriate! We are involved in serious research here!",
"Ancano: Yes, I've no doubt of its gravity. This, however, is a matter that        cannot wait.",
"Tolfdir: Well, I'm quite sure I've never been interrupted like this before...         the audacity!... I suppose we'll continue this at some later time,         when we can avoid interruptions.",
"Ancano: I need you to come with me immediately. Let's go.",
"Dragonborn: I don't understand what's going on.",
"Ancano: Really? Well, allow me to clarify the situation. I'd like to know why        there's someone claiming to be from the Psijic Order here at the        College. More importantly, I'd like to know why he's asking for you        specifically. So we're going to go have a little chat with him, and        find out exactly what it is he wants.",
"Why are you so concerned about this?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I'll be the one asking the questions. All you need to know is that the         Psijic Order is a rogue organization, believing themselves to be above         the law. They have clashed with the Aldmeri Dominion before, and I         have no intention of allowing that to happen here.",
"Aren't you just an advisor here?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Technically, that is true. But I still report to the Aldmeri Dominion,         and I cannot ignore this situation. Don't worry, you can return to         your petty squabbles and meaningless 'research' as soon as this matter         is resolved.",
"Now, you are going to speak to this...Monk...and find out why he is        here, and then he will be removed from College grounds.",
"Quaranir: Please do not be alarmed. I mean you no harm. It is good to meet you          in person.",
"What's going on? What happened to everyone?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I'd simply like to talk to you.",
"What do you want with me?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I merely wish to talk to you.",
"What did you do?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           ---",
"If this is dangerous, then why don't you do something about it?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I'm afraid it's not that simple.",
"What does this have to do with me?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           You set this chain of events in motion at Saarthal.",
"You must understand, the Psijic Order does not typically...intervene          directly in events. My presence here will be seen as an affront to          some within the Order, and as soon as we have finished, I will be          leaving your College. I'm all too aware that my presence has aroused          suspicion, especially in Ancano, you Thalmor associate. Nevertheless,          my Order will not act directly. You must take it upon yourself to do          so.",
"So what exactly is the problem?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           As you may have learned, this object...The Eye...is immensely           powerful. The world is not ready for it. If it remains here, it will           be misused. Indeed, many in the Order believe it has already...           Rather, something will happen soon, something that cannot be           avoided.",
"What do you expect from me, then?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            We believe that your efforts should be directed toward dealing with            the aftermath, but we cannot predict what that will be.",
"Who is the Augur of Dunlain?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             He was once a student here at the College. Now he is...something             different.",
"Where can I find this Augur?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             I...I am unsure. He is somewhere within the College. Surely one             of your colleagues must know his location. I am sorry I cannot             provide you with further help, but this conversation requires a             great deal of effort on my part. Now, I am afraid I must leave             you. We will continue to watch over you, and guide you as best we             can. It is within you to succeed. Never forget that.",
"Why should I trust you or your Order?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I presume you refer to Ancano's distaste for the Psijic Order? The           Thalmor see our Order as a threat because we have power, and we will           not allow them to control us. I assure you that we mean you no harm.",
"Savos: I'm sorry, were you about to say something?",
"Ancano: Well? What is the meaning of this?",
"Quaranir: I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't understand.",
"Ancano: Don't play coy. You asked to see a specific member of the College. Here        he is. Now what is it you want?",
"Quaranir: There's been a misunderstanding. Clearly I should not be here. I          shall simply take my leave.",
"Ancano: What? What trickery is this? You're not going anywhere until I find out        what you're up to!",
"Quaranir: I am not 'up to' anything. I apologize if I have offended you in any          way.",
"Ancano: We will see about this...",
"Savos: I'm...I'm not sure what happened. A monk from the Psijic Order, here,       after all these years, and then he just leaves. I hope we didn't offend       him somehow.",
"Dragonborn: Have you ever heard of the Augur of Dunlain?",
"Savos: Has Tolfdir been telling stories again? I thought I made it quite clear       that this was a subject inappropriate for conversation. Please don't       allow him to continue to discuss the subject.",
"Dragonborn: Have you ever heard of the Augur of Dunlain?",
"Tolfdir: Well now, there's a name I haven't heard in some time. My goodness,         it's been years since I've spoken with him. I suppose he's still down         in the Midden, but I haven't checked. Are you going to see him? Do         tell him 'hello' for me, won't you?",
"Dragonborn: Where is the Midden?",
"Tolfdir: Underneath the College. It's not the nicest place, so if you go down         there, please be careful.",
"Dragonborn: Can you tell me more about the Augur of Dunlain?",
"Tolfdir: Well, I suppose he wouldn't mind... It was all before my time, you         understand. I've heard the stories, the same as anyone else. He was a         brilliant student, an accomplished wizard. Delved into magic in a way         none had seen before. But, I think, he became too focused on just how         much power he could acquire. That's what led to the accident.",
"Augur: There is no help for you here. There is no solace in knowing what is to       come.",
"Augur: Your perseverence will only lead to disappointment. Still you persist?       Very well, you may enter.",
"Dragonborn: So you're the Augur of Dunlain?",
"Augur: I am that which you have been seeking. Your efforts are in vain. It has       already begun. But those who have sent you have not told you what they       seek. What you seek.",
"And what is it I'm seeking?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        You see that which all who wield magic seek. Knowledge. You shall find        this: Knowledge will corrupt. It will destroy. It will consume. You        seek meaning, shelter in Knowledge. You will not find it. The Thalmor        sought the same thing, and it shall lead to his end as it has so many        others.",
"Thalmor? What Thalmor?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        The one who calls himself Ancano. He seeks information about the Eye,        but what he will find shall be quite different. His path will cross        yours in time, but first you must find that which you need.",
"Dragonborn: What do I need?",
"Augur: You, and those aiding you, wish to know more about the Eye of Magnus.       You wish to avoid the disaster of which you are not yet aware. To see       through Magnus' Eye without being blinded, you require his staff. Events       now spiral quickly towards the inevitable center, so you must act with       haste. Take this knowledge to your Arch-Mage.",
"Dragonborn: I have important information for you.",
"Savos: Really? And what might that be?",
"Dragonborn: We need to find the Staff of Magnus.",
"Savos: I'm sorry, what? Well...I'd certainly love to have such a powerful       staff, but I'm not really sure that any of us need it.",
"Dragonborn: It's connected to the orb we found.",
"Savos: And how do you know of this?",
"Dragonborn: I spoke with the Augur of Dunlain.",
"Savos: Did you really? And he specifically mentioned the Staff of Magnus? I...       I'm impressed with your initiative. Of course, someone will need to       follow up on this.",
"What should I do next?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        A most impressive attitude. Keep this up, and you'll do quite well for        yourself.",
"You mean me, don't you?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        I certainly do. Since you went so far as to seek out the Augur for        advice, I thought you'd be more enthusiastic.",
"Something as specific and ancient as the Staff of Magnus...I'm not sure       we'd ever find something like that... I seem to recall Mirabelle       mentioning the staff somewhat recently. Why don't you see if she can       tell you anything? I'm quite pleased with your progress, you know.       You've certainly proven yourself to be more than a mere Apprentice. Well       done. This circlet once proved invaluable to me. I hope it can be of use       to you know.",
"Dragonborn: Do you know anything about the Staff of Magnus?",
"Mirabelle: Well now that's an odd question. Why in the world would you be           asking?",
"Arch-Mage Aren said you'd mentioned it recently.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            I see. Well yes, I suppose I did mention it, though I'm not sure            what he expects me to tell you. I only brought it to his attention            a few months back when the Synod showed up here looking for it.            They were apparently under the impression we were keeping it in a            closet somewhere.",
"It may be connected to the Eye of Magnus.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            The 'Eye of Magnus'? I can appreciate that this...thing, this            Orb... It's very impressive. Very unique, and definitely worth            studying. But let's not jump to any conclusions, or assign it            importance beyond what we're certain of.",
"The Augur referred to it as the Eye of Magnus, not me.            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             The Augur? Just what have you gotten yourself involved in?             Whatever is going on, whatever you're up to... Be very careful.",
"Sorry. So, the Staff of Magnus?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             Well, it's said to be very powerful. Has the capacity to store an             incredible amount of magical power, as the story goes. But it's             more myth than anything at this point. I've no doubt it actually             exists, but no one has seen it in what, decades? Longer? I'm not             sure. The only time I've heard it mentioned was when those Synod             characters showed up some months ago looking for it.",
"Dragonborn: Who are the Synod?",
"Mirabelle: Mages based out of Cyrodiil. They fancy themselves the Imperial           Authority on magic these last few hundred years. My understanding           is that all they really do is make noise in an attempt to curry           favor from the Emperor. Lots of politics, little magic. I was quite           surprised to find them on our doorstep. They seemed amiable enough,           but their line of questioning made me...uneasy. It became clear           they're trying to hoard powerful artifacts, looking to consolidate           power.",
"Dragonborn: So no one knows the Staff's location?",
"Mirabelle: No one here does. The Synod seemed convinced it was somewhere here           in Skyrim. They inquired about the ruins of Mzulft, but that's all           I remember. It sounded like they were heading there, though they           were rather secretive about why. I suppose if you're intent on           looking for the staff, there's a chance they might be in Mzulft           yet. Just don't expect them to be cooperative.",
"Dragonborn: What else can you tell me about the Staff of Magnus?",
"Mirabelle: I'm not really sure. Made and used by Magnus himself, if you believe           those sorts of things. I believe I've heard it said that it's the           only thing that could adequately contain his power. The sort of           embellishment wizards of ancient times loved to make.",
"Gavros Plinius: Crystal...gone... Find...Paratus...in Oculory... Gah...",
"Paratus: What the... What are you doing here? What've you done with Gavros?",
"Your friend Gavros is dead.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          It was the Falmer, wasn't it? Curse them! They've ruined everything!          If Gavros is gone, there's no hope. He was supposed to return with          the crystal... Without that, all our efforts are wasted. And you. If          you're here for treasure, or wisdom, or anything, I'm afraid you've          wasted your time.",
"Dragonborn: What's this about a crystal?",
"Paratus: It didn't work the first time. I tried to tell Gavros, but he wouldn't         listen. 'No, it won't be too cold' he said. Well, I was right, wasn't         I? Focused completely wrong by the time we got here! The cold had         warped it! Gavros had to cart it all the way back to Cyrodiil. Left         the rest of us here to fend off the damnable Falmer.",
"What's the crystal for?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          It was a brilliant idea, really. Mostly mine, though Gavros took the          credit. Secret, though. Official Synod business. Can't talk about it.",
"If I find this crystal you're looking for. Will you help me?²         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I don't know what sort of help you expect from me, but if you can          actually find the crystal I'd certainly be grateful.",
"Dragonborn: What are you doing here?",
"Paratus: I am on official business of the Grand Council of the Synod. That's         all you need to know. I might well ask the same of you, running around         by yourself in this dangerous place.",
"Dragonborn: I'm looking for the Staff of Magnus.",
"Paratus: Are you? Well. I'm afraid I can't help you with that. I need the         crystal to do anything useful, and I don't have it.",
"Paratus: Please, tell me you have the crystal. I've no wish to die in this         place.",
"Dragonborn: I found your crystal.",
"Paratus: Ha! So you did. I was almost beginning to think Gavros had gone and         gotten himself killed just to spite me. Well, with the Falmer skulking         around I can't very well do this on my own. I guess you'll have to         come with me. I'll explain on the way.",
"Paratus: No matter what Gavros said, this was my idea first. The Council is         going to know that when I get back. I was the one who thought of using         this...this Oculory. I don't know what the dwarves called it.         Something unpronounceable, I'm sure. From all our research, it seems         they were intent on discerning the nature of the divine. This         machinery, all of it, was designed to collect starlight, and then...         I'm not sure. Split it, somehow? It was my idea to replace one of the         key elements with our focusing crystal. Months of enchantments went         into it. Let's just hope they got it right this time.",
"Paratus: Here it is. Magnificent, isn't it? Took an incredible amount of work         to get it running again. Now I'm hoping it'll all be worth it. Place         the crystal in the central apparatus, and we can start the process         for focusing it.",
"Dragonborn: What do I do?",
"Paratus: Now the crystal needs to be focused. It was created so far away, we         knew that some adjustments would have to be made. Heating and cooling         the crystal will cause it to expand or contract, which will change         how the light passes through it. You'll need to use spells to do that.         Being from the College, I assume you know them already. There should         be a few basic tomes around here somewhere in case your training is         even more substandard than I've heard.",
"Paratus: Years of work, finally going to pay off... ...but what's this? These         results... They're not at all what they should be. This projection         should be lit up like the night sky... Something is creating an         incredible amount of interference. Something in Winterhold, it looks         like. What are you playing at? Is this some attempt to stall my work?!         So, what is it? What have you done? Did you know what we were         attempting? Are you here to make sure your plan worked, that our         efforts have been for nothing? Well, explain yourself!",
"You'd better calm down.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          You and your College have ruined years of my work, I've lost friends          and colleagues to the Falmer, and you want me to calm down?",
"Did something go wrong?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Go wrong? Go wrong? Everything is wrong! Everything! Whatever you          have at that College has completely interfered with our work here.",
"How did you do it?",
"You have something at your College, don't you? Something immensely         powerful. Beyond anything I'd anticipated. What is it?",
"You mean the Eye of Magnus?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          The Eye of Magnus? Well, I suppose if that means what I think it          does... Well, that's interesting...",
"We might have something, yes.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Well, now. This I hadn't considered. If that's taken into account,          these results make more sense.",
"Can you help me find the Staff of Magnus or not?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Yes, the staff. Interesting...",
"What are you talking about?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          You're looking for something, yes? The...Staff of Magnus. Well, even          if you are trying to ruin my work, there's still something to be          learned here.",
"So the Staff of Magnus is in Labyrinthian?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Well, yes. Probably. I mean, yes. Certainly it is, but that doesn't          matter now, because I know you're hoarding something even more          important at your College. The Council will be informed of this. They          will find out what you're up to.",
"Mirabelle: I don't know. It's like a ward, but who's casting it? Ancano? How?",
"Savos: I don't care what it is, I want it down now! I want to know what he's       doing in there!",
"Dragonborn: What's going on?",
"Savos: Ancano. He's in there, doing...something. We don't know what. We're       trying to get in now. I will have his head for this, I assure you. Help       take this down, will you? We're throwing everything we can at it.",
"Dragonborn: I know where to find the Staff of Magnus.",
"Savos: Now's not the time. We need to put a stop to whatever it is that's going       on.",
"Mirabelle: What's going on?!",
"Savos: Ancano! Stop this at once! I command you!",
"Mirabelle: Don't go near him!",
"Mirabelle: Are you all right? Can you walk? I need you on your feet. We're in           trouble here.",
"Dragonborn: I think I'm okay.",
"Mirabelle: Ancano is doing something with that thing...the Eye. We can't stop           him! I haven't seen Savos since the explosion. He must've been blown           clear, and he may have be injured. I need you to find the Arch-Mage,           and I need you to do it quickly! Get moving!",
"Dragonborn: What happened?",
"Mirabelle: I'll be fine. I just need a minute to catch my breath. Find Savos...",
"Sergius Turrianus: What's happened? He's not...",
"Phinius: Is he dead?",
"Tolfdir: Everyone please, stand back! Please remain calm! Are you all right?         What happened in there?",
"It's Ancano. He's done something with the Eye!         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          By the Nine... Is he responsible for this? The Arch-Mage, dead?          There's more. Something's happened to Winterhold. It must be whatever          Ancano did. You need to get out there and make sure it's safe.          Quickly now, quickly! I'll find Mirabelle and see if we can't put a          stop to this!",
"Arch-Mage aren is dead?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I can hardly believe it. But there's no time. Whatever happened here          has affected Winterhold as well. I need you to get out there and make          sure everything's all right. I'll do what I can here. Go now, go!",
"Faralda: What's going on? What happened in there?",
"Something went wrong. Winterhold may be in danger. Can you help?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          It 'may be' in danger? Take a look. I don't think there's much          question. Let's get down there. We have to do something. Come on,          Arniel. Let's go.",
"Arniel: Do we have to? They'd never lift a finger to help us.",
"There's no time. We have to make sure Winterhold is safe.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          We'll go with you, but when this is all over I want an explanation.",
"Faralda: That looks like it was the last of them. We'll stay here. Get back to         the College and let them know what's going on. Arniel, stay on your         guard. We can't let harm come to these people.",
"Mirabelle: Well? Is everything out there all right?",
"Dragonborn: Winterhold is safe for now.",
"Mirabelle: Wish I could say the same for us. Tolfdir and I can try and keep           this contained. You need to get your hands on the Staff of Magnus.           Now.",
"Why me?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            I've got to stay here, to see if we can get to Ancano and stop            this. I need someone I can trust to do it. Besides, you're the one            having all of these visions, aren't you?",
"You really think the Staff will help?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            You were told to find it, weren't you? If the stories about the            staff are true, if it really can absorb a tremendous amount of            power, maybe we can break through Ancano's magic.",
"Then I'm off to Labyrinthian.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            What? Are you... Are you sure? The staff is there? That can't be            a coincidence.",
"What are you talking about?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             The Arch-Mage.",
"He... He gave me something just a little while ago. He told me it            was from Labyrinthian, and that I would know what to do with it            when the time came. I think...I think he meant this for you, then.            I'm not sure why, but there was something very personal about it            for him. Also, I think you should take this amulet. It belonged to            Savos, but I think it would do you the most good now. Take it, and            get out of here. Bring back that staff before Ancano brings the            whole College down around us.",
"Savos: Come on, we're finally here! Let's not waste any more time!",
"Takes-In-Light: Are we truly sure this is a good idea?",
"Atmah: We'll be back at the College before anyone even knows we're gone.",
"Girduin: You would care about that, since you're the Arch-Mage's favorite!",
"Savos: Don't forget, this whole idea was Atmah's to begin with.",
"Hafnar: Let's just get inside, see what's in there.",
"Elvali: I can't believe we're doing this.",
"Savos: Can you imagine the looks on their faces when we come back?",
"Hafnar: You keep talking like you're sure we'll find something useful in here.",
"Savos: Enchanted weapons, tomes of ancient knowledge, Shalidor's secrets       themselves -- who knows what we could find!",
"Takes-In-Light: And what if... What if there are things guarding this place?",
"Atmah: Against six College-trained mages? I think we'll be fine.",
"Elvali: We...we have to go back. We can't leave Girduin...",
"Hafnar: We barely made it out alive, and you want to go back in?",
"Takes-In-Light: What was that thing anyway?",
"Atmah: It's too late. There isn't enough of him left to back in after.",
"Takes-In-Light: Gods, what have we done?",
"Savos: We can't go back. Might as well go forward. We can still do this.",
"Atmah: Savos is right. We can make it if we just stay alert.",
"Takes-In-Light: Just another minute, please.",
"Savos: Come on, we can't stop now. We have to keep moving!",
"Atmah: Where's Elvali? She was right behind me.",
"Hafnar: Dead. Something grabbed her from behind. Gone before I could do        anything.",
"Atmah: You're right. This is all my fault. Should we turn around, head back?",
"Hafnar: I don't think going back is a good idea.",
"Savos: Going back would be the end of all of us. We keep pushing forward, and       we'll make it. We will!",
"Atmah: Come on, you can make it. Let's go.",
"Atmah: We shouldn't have left her there to die!",
"Savos: What else could we do? Stay there and die with her? She refused to go       on, we didn't have a choice!",
"Hafnar: This is it, you know. Through this door. Can you feel it?",
"Atmah: We're not going to make it, are we?",
"Hafnar: We stay together, no matter what. Agreed?",
"Atmah: I'll be right with you.",
"Savos: Agreed. We all stay together.",
"Savos: ...I'm sorry, friends. I'm so sorry! I had no choice! It was the only       way to make sure that monster never escaped! I promise you, I'll never       let this happen again! I'll seal this whole place away...",
"Estormo: So, you made it out of there alive. Ancano was right...you are         dangerous. I'm afraid I'll have to take that Staff from you now.         Ancano wants it kept safe...oh, and he wants you dead. Nothing         personal.",
"Get out of my way.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          You fool. You don't stand a chance.",
"Arniel: I hope there aren't any more.",
"Tolfdir: You survived! You have it, then? Let's hope it's as powerful as the         Psijics believe it to be.",
"Where's Mirabelle?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          She... She didn't make it. When it was clear we were going to have          to fall back, she stayed behind and made sure the rest of us were          all right.",
"Why are you all the way out here?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Look for yourself. Ancano's power is growing. We can't crack whatever          magic he's using to shield himself. I hope your trip to Labyrinthian          was worth it.",
"Let's get in there.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I'll be right behind you!",
"Arniel: I'll be amazed if any of us survive this.",
"Faralda: We never should have brought that thing here.",
"Ancano: You've come for me, have you? You think I don't know what you're up to?        You think I can't destroy you? The power to unmake the world at my        fingertips, and you think you can do anything about it?",
"Tolfdir: Spells have no effect!",
"Ancano: I am beyond your pathetic attempts at magic. You cannot touch me.",
"Tolfdir: The Staff! Use it on the Eye!",
"Ancano: Enough!",
"Ancano: Still you persist? Very well. Come then. See what I can do now.",
"Tolfdir: I knew you could do it!",
"Dragonborn: What do we do now?",
"Tolfdir: I...I don't know. Ancano is gone, but whatever he's done to the Eye         doesn't seem to have stopped. I have no idea what to do!",
"Quaranir: We knew you would succeed. Your victory here justifies our belief in          you. You have proven yourself more than worthy to guide the College          of Winterhold.",
"What do we do now?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           The Eye has grown unstable. It cannot remain here, or else it may           destroy your College and this world. It must be secured. Ancano's           actions prove the world is not ready for such a thing. We shall           safeguard it...for now. You now have the opportunity to maintain           your College, and carry on with your lives. You have our gratitude,           Arch-Mage.",
"How did you know I'd be able to defeat Ancano?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           A great many things obscured to you are quite clear to us. We have           long believed you would prevail.",
"Tolfdir: You've done it! The College is safe again, thanks to your work. I knew         you had it in you. I daresay the Psijics are right. There's no one         more deserving to be Arch-Mage, in my opinion. Here, consider these         yours. And the Arch-Mage's quarters as well. I shall be here for         advice, should you need me.",
"Aela: • You handle yourself well. You could make for a decent Shield-Brother.      • Well, that's taken care of. No thanks to you.",
"You didn't look like you needed help.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Certainly not. But a true warrior would have relished the opportunity         to take on a giant. That's why I'm here with my Shield-Brothers.",
"Aela: An outsider, eh? Never heard of the Companions? An order of warriors.      We are brothers and sisters in honor. And we show up to solve problems      if the coin is good enough.",
"Can I join you?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Not for me to say. You'll have to talk to Kodlak Whitemane up in       Jorrvaskr. The old man's got a good sense for people. He can look in       your eyes and tell your worth. If you go to him, good luck.",
"Sounds like a waste of time.      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Well nobody asked you. If you think you're better than we are, go talk       to Kodlak Whitemane. See what a warrior of true mettle is like.",
"Skjor: Are those two at it again? Strike when the shoulder turns. He's giving       you openings!",
"Farkas: This should be good.",
"Brill: Just keep swinging!",
"Njada: Going to enjoy killing you!",
"Athis: Azura curse you!",
"Vilkas: But I still hear the call of the blood.",
"Kodlak: We all do. It is our burden to bear. But we can overcome.",
"Vilkas: You have my brother and I, obviously. But I don't know if the rest will        go along quite so easily.",
"Kodlak: Leave that to me.",
"Dragonborn: I'd like to join the Companions.",
"Kodlak: Would you now? Here, let me have a look at you? Hmm. Yes, perhaps. A        certain strength of spirit.",
"Vilkas: Master, you're not truly considering accepting him?",
"Kodlak: I am nobody's master, Vilkas. And last I checked, we had some empty        beds in Jorrvaskr for those with a fire burning in hearts.",
"Vilkas: Apologies. But perhaps this isn't the time. I've never even heard of        this outsider.",
"Kodlak: Sometimes the famous come to us. Sometimes men and women come to us to        seek their fame. It makes no difference. What matters is their heart.",
"Vilkas: And their arm.",
"Kodlak: Of course. How are you in a battle, boy?",
"You dare question my skill?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Calm down there, whelp. Don't feel like you need to show off for our         sake. Vilkas, here, will be the one testing your mettle.",
"Vilkas, take him out to the yard and see what he can do.",
"Vilkas: Aye.",
"Vilkas: The old man said to have a look at you, so let's do this. Just have a        few swings at me so I can see your form. Don't worry, I can take it.",
"Vilkas: What do you think this is? We don't do battle with magic around here,        new blood. Now come at me.",
"Vilkas: There you go! Not bad. Next time won't be so easy! You might just make        it. But until then, you're still just a whelp to us, new blood. So you        do what we tell you to. Here's my sword. Go take it up to Eorlund to        have it sharpened. And be careful, it's probably worth more than you        are.",
"Eorlund Gray-Mane: What brings you here?",
"Dragonborn: Vilkas sent me with his sword.",
"Eorlund: I'm guessing you're the newcomer then?",
"Does Vilkas always send newcomers on errands?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Oh, don't worry about that. They were all whelps once. They just          might not like to talk about it. And don't always just do what you're          told. Nobody rules anybody in the Companions.",
"Dragonborn: Someone has to be in charge, though.",
"Eorlund: Well, I'm not sure how they've managed it, but they have. No leaders         since Ysgramor. Kodlak is the Harbinger, and he's a sort of advisor         for the whole group, but every man is his own. Every woman, her own.",
"Dragonborn: I'll need to be going.",
"Eorlund: I have a favor to ask.",
"Dragonborn: What is it?",
"Eorlund: I've been working on a shield for Aela. My wife is in mourning and I         need to get back to her soon. I'd be much obliged if you could take         this to Aela for me.",
"Didn't you just tell me not to be a servant?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          This isn't a command...just decency. Help out an old blacksmith. I've          got to get back to my work.",
"Dragonborn: I have your shield.",
"Aela the Huntress: Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Are you new around                   here?",
"Skjor: I told you, this is the whelp that Vilkas mentioned.",
"Aela: Ah, yes. I heard you gave him quite a thrashing.",
"Skjor: Don't let Vilkas catch you saying that.",
"Aela: Do you think you could handle Vilkas in a real fight?",
"Here, let's have Farkas show you where you'll be resting your head.",
"Skjor: Farkas!",
"Farkas: Did you call me?",
"Aela: Of course we did, icebrain. Show this new blood where the rest of the      whelps sleep.",
"Farkas: New blood? Oh, hello. I'm Farkas. Come, follow me.",
"Farkas: Skjor and Aela like to tease me, but they're good people. They        challenge us to be our best. Nice to have a new face around. It gets        boring here sometimes. I hope we keep you. This can be a rough life.        The quarters are up here. Just pick a bed and fall in it when you're        tired. Tilma will keep the place clean; she always has. Alright, so        here you are. Looks like the others are eager to meet you. Come to me        or Aela if you're looking for work. Once you've made a bit of a name        for yourself, Skjor and Vilkas might have things for you to do. Good        luck. Welcome to the Companions.",
"Dragonborn: I'm looking for work.",
"Farkas: Skjor was looking for you earlier.",
"Dragonborn: What does he want?",
"Farkas: Don't know. He just said he needed to talk to you before you do        anything else. I don't like making him angry, but there is some work        for you if you want it.",
"Skjor: Ah, there you are.",
"Dragonborn: You wanted to see me?",
"Skjor: I did. Your time, it seems, has come.",
"Dragonborn: What do you mean?",
"Skjor: Last week a scholar came to us. He said he knew where we could find       another fragment of Wuuthrad. He seemed a fool to me, but if he's right,       the honor of the Companions demands we seek it out.",
"What does this have to do with me?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        This is a simple errand, but the time is right for it to be your Trial.        Carry yourself with honor, and you'll become a true Companion.",
"Farkas will be your Shield-Sibling on this venture, whelp. He'll answer       any questions you have. Try not to disappoint...or get him killed.",
"Farkas: I hope you've readied yourself.",
"Dragonborn: You're going to be my Shield-Brother?",
"Farkas: So I'm told. Let's see if you impress.",
"Who was this scholar?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         A smart man came and told us about a blade piece. Skjor thinks you         should find it, and I'm supposed to watch you.",
"What is Wuuthrad?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Ysgramor was the hero who stared the Companions. Wuuthrad was his         weapon. He came from the ancient homeland and killed all the elves.         But not all of 'em, because some of 'em are still here.",
"Why did Skjor call this my Trial?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I watch you to make sure you're honorable. If you are honorable and         strong, I can call you brother.",
"Farkas: Looks like someone'd been digging here. And recently. Tread lightly.        Be careful around the burial stones. I don't want to haul you back to        Jorrvaskr on my back.",
"Farkas: Now look what you've gotten yourself into. No worries. Just sit tight.        I'll find the release.",
"Silver Hand: It's time to die, dog.",
"Silver Hand 2: We knew you'd be coming here.",
"Silver Hand 3: Your mistake, Companion.",
"Silver Hand 4: Which one is that?",
"Silver Hand 5: It doesn't matter. He wears that armor, he dies.",
"Silver Hand 4: Killing you will make for an excellent story.",
"Farkas: None of you will be alive to tell it.",
"Farkas: I hope I didn't scare you.",
"Dragonborn: What was that?",
"Farkas: It's a blessing given to some of us. We can be like wild beasts.        Fearsome.",
"Dragonborn: You're going to make me a werewolf?",
"Farkas: Oh, no. Only the Circle have the beastblood. Prove your honor to be a        Companion. 'Eyes on the prey, not the horizon.' We should keep moving.        Still the draugr to worry about.",
"Who are the Silver Hand?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Bad people who don't like werewolves. So they don't like us either.",
"The Companions are werewolves?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Not everyone, but all the Circle are. It's a secret to everybody.",
"Kodlak: Brothers and sisters of the Circle, today we welcome a new soul into        our mortal fold. This man has endured, has challenged, and has shown        his valor. Who will speak for him?",
"Farkas: I stand witness to the courage of the soul before us.",
"Kodlak: Would you raise your shield in his defense?",
"Farkas: I would stand at his back, that the world might never overtake us.",
"Kodlak: And would you raise your sword in his honor?",
"Farkas: It stands ready to meet the blood of his foes.",
"Kodlak: And would you raise a mug in his name?",
"Farkas: I would lead the song of triumph as our mead hall reveled in his        stories.",
"Kodlak: Then the judgment of this Circle is complete. His heart beats with fury        and courage that have united the Companions since the days of the        distant green summers. Let it beat with ours, that the mountains may        echo and our enemies may tremble at the call.",
"Companions: It shall be so.",
"Kodlak: Well, boy, you're one of us now. I trust you won't disappoint.",
"Is it true that the Companions are werewolves?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        I see you've been allowed to know some secrets before your appointed        time. No matter. Yes, it's true. Not every Companion, though. Only        members of the Circle all share the blood of the beast. Some take to        it more than others.",
"What about you?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Well, I grow old. My mind turns towards the horizon. To Sovngarde. I         worry that Shor won't call an animal to glory as he would a true Nord         warrior. Living as beasts draws our souls closer to the Daedric Lord         Hircine. Some may prefer an eternity in his Hunting Grounds, but I         crave the fellowship of Sovngarde.",
"You're looking to cure yourself?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Yes, but it's no easy matter. But you don't need to share the worries          of an old warrior. This day is to rejoice in your bravery! And speak          to Eorlund if you want a better weapon than...whatever that is.",
"Dragonborn: I was told you would have a weapon for me.",
"Eorlund: Yes, lad, you've been raised into the Companions, I hear. I can forge         whatever kind of weapon you want. Finest forge in Skyrim, right here         before you.",
"Skjor: Yes, I have something special for you. But it's not for everyone to       hear. Meet me in the Underforge tonight. We will speak more.",
"Dragonborn: Where is this Underforge?",
"Skjor: I forget that you've never seen it. Beneath the Skyforge, where Eorlund       works. The door is hidden, but I will show you the way.",
"Skjor: Are you prepared?",
"What is this place?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Here's all you need to know. Jorrvaskr is the oldest building in        Whiterun. The Skyforge was here long before it was. And the Underforge        taps an ancient magic that is older than men or elves. We bring you        here to make you stronger, new blood. Now, let's move.",
"Skjor: I'm glad you came. It's been a long time since we've had a heart like       yours in our numbers. That pitiful ceremony behind the hall does not       befit warriors like us. You are due more honor than some calls and       feasting. I would hope you recognize Aela, even in this form. She's       agreed to be your forebear.",
"We do this in secret because Kodlak is too busy trying to throw away       this great gift we've been granted. He thinks we've been cursed. But       we've been blessed. How could something that gives this type of prowess       be a curse? So we take matters into our own hands.",
"To reach the heights of the Companions, you must join with us in the       shared blood of the wolf. Are you prepared to join your spirit with the       beast world, friend?",
"What if I don't want to be a werewolf?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         That is your choice. We will not force you. But to join the Circle,         your blood must be as ours. Meet us here when you're ready.",
"Aela: Are you awake? I was starting to think you might never come back. Yours      was not an easy transformation, but you're still alive. Congratulations.      We even have a celebration planned for you. There's a pack of werewolf      hunters camped nearby, at Gallows Rock. The Silver Hand. I think you've      met them before. We're going to slaughter them. All of them. Lead on.      Skjor's already scouting ahead.",
"What just happened?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       You were born into the pack, brother. I almost envy you, that first       time is always the most...intense. You gave us even more trouble than       Farkas did in his first turning.",
"Am I a werewolf now?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       You have the blood in you. You'll need to build up your strength before       you're able to call on it again, though. Just be careful where you do       it. Some cowards in this land can't stand the sight of glory before       them.",
"What does it mean to be a werewolf?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Nothing, until you choose to use it. Then, well...you got a taste.       Stronger, faster. It doesn't last long, though. The blood of your foes       can sustain you. If you're willing to feed. The more we feed, the       greater our prowess will grow. We could perhaps discover even more gifts       than Hircine.",
"Is there a cure?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Cure? Ha. You're sounding like the old man. I...I shouldn't say that. I       love Kodlak. I respect and follow him. But he's wrong on this. It's no       curse. We're made into the greatest hunters in the land. If he's worried       about some mead-swilling afterlife in Sovngarde, he's free to pursue it.       I'll take the glories of the hunt right here.",
"Where are we going?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       The Silver Hand have taken over the old fort at Gallows Rock. They       always make such easy prey.",
"Aela: Look at this. Cowards must have locked the place down after Skjor charged      in. You can taste the fear.",
"Aela: There's a dead one, isn't there. Thought so. Nobody we know, by the      smell. Some can't separate the animal from themselves, go feral. This      poor sod could have been anyone. We should keep moving.",
"Aela: No surprise they keep vermin around. Filthy squalor.",
"Aela: Nothing we can do for these ones now. Don't even want to think about what      those cretins did to them before they died.",
"Aela: We're getting close now, be careful. Their leader is a tricky one. They      call him 'The Skinner'. I don't think I need to tell you why.",
"Aela: The bastards...somehow they managed to kill Skjor. He's one of the      strongest we had, but numbers can overwhelm. He should not have come      without a Shield-Brother. Get out of here. I'm going to make sure we got      the last of them, and see if there's any information to be gotten from      the bodies. You and I have work to do. The Silver Hand will tremble at      our sight._____________________¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|[CMP4] BLOOD'S HONOR |=========================================================_____________________|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ [After two radiant quests for Aela, in which a Wuuthrad piece is claimed, it's time to make good on an earlier vow.]",
"Dragonborn: I'm looking for work.",
"Aela: And there is more work to be done, but I fear that Kodlak has gotten wind      of our recent efforts. He's asked to see you. My advice? Always be honest      with the old man, but don't tell him anything he doesn't need to know.",
"Kodlak: Thank you for coming.",
"Dragonborn: You wanted to see me.",
"Kodlak: Yes, youngling. Have a seat. I hear you've been busy of late.",
"Aela and I work to avenge Skjor's death.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Your hearts are full of grief, and my own weeps at the loss of Skjor.         But his death was avenged long ago. You have taken more lives than         honor demanded. The cycle of retaliation may continue for some time.",
"In any case, I have a task for you. Have you heard the story of how we        came to be werewolves?",
"Skjor said it was a blessing of Hircine.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Aye, that sounds like him. As in all matters of faith, though, the         reality is more complicated than one believer would tell you.",
"Vilkas said it was a curse laid upon the ancient Companions.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         The boy has a nugget of truth, but the reality is more complicated         than that. It always is.",
"Dragonborn: So what is the truth, then?",
"Kodlak: The Companions are nearly five thousand years old. This matter of        beastblood is only troubled us for a few hundred. One of my        predecessors was a good but short-sighted man. He made a bargain with        the witches of Glenmoril Coven. If the Companions would hunt in the        name of their lord Hircine, we would be granted great power.",
"Dragonborn: And they became werewolves?",
"Kodlak: They did not believe the change would be permanent. The witches offered        payment, like anyone else. But we had been deceived.",
"But aren't you more powerful now?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         The witches didn't lie, of course. But it's more than our bodies.",
"The witches should be hunted down for their trickery.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         We'll get to that. It's not so simple as just killing them, though.",
"The disease, you see, affects not just our bodies. It seeps into our        spirit. Upon death, werewolves are claimed by Hircine for his Hunting        Grounds. For some, this is paradise. They want nothing more than to        chase prey with their mastery for eternity. And that is their choise.        But I am a true Nord. I wish for Sovngarde as my spirit home.",
"Dragonborn: Is there a way to cure yourself?",
"Kodlak: That's what I've spent my twilight years trying to find out. And now I        think I've found an answer. The witches' magic ensnared us, and their        magic can release us. They won't give it willingly, but we can extract        their foul powers by force. I want you to seek them out. Go to their        coven in the wilderness. Strike them down as a true warrior of the        wild. And bring me their heads. The seat of their abilities. From        there, we may begin to undo centuries of impurity.",
"Am I to do this alone?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         You shall have no Shield-Brother this time. But the spirit of Ysgramor         goes with you, to restore the honor of his legacy. Talos guide you,         lad.",
"It shall be done.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Good. Now move quickly. And don't leave any of them alive. Talos guide         you, lad.",
"Vilkas: Where have you been?",
"What happened here?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         One of the fiercest battles I've ever seen.",
"The Silver Hand. They finally found enough courage to attack Jorrvaskr.        We fought them off, but...the old man...Kodlak...he's dead.",
"Dragonborn: Was anyone else hurt?",
"Vilkas: No, but they made off with all our fragments of Wuuthrad. But you and I        are going to reclaim them. We will bring the battle to their chief        camp. There will be none left living to tell their stories. Only songs        of Jorrvaskr will be sung. We will avenge Kodlak...and they know will        terror before the end.",
"Vilkas: The others have probably prepared Kodlak's funeral by now. Come up to        the Skyforge to pay your respects.",
"Eorlund: Who will start?",
"Aela: I'll do it. Before the ancient flame...",
"Companions: We grieve.",
"Eorlund: At this loss...",
"Companions: We weep.",
"Vilkas: For the fallen...",
"Companions: We shout.",
"Farkas: And for ourselves...",
"Companions: We take our leave.",
"Aela: His spirit is departed. Members of the Circle, let us withdraw to the      Underforge, to grieve our last together.",
"Eorlund: Do you have the fragments of Wuuthrad still? I'll need to prepare         them for mounting again.",
"Here, take them. (Give fragments)         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Careful with those. Don't want even more fragments, do we?",
"Of course, I have a small favor to ask of you. There is another piece         that Kodlak always kept close to himself. Would you go to his chambers         and bring it back for me? I'm not sure I'm the best one to go through         his things.",
"It would be my pleasure.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Thank you. I'll be here.",
"Eorlund: You're back.",
"Dragonborn: I have Kodlak's fragment.",
"Eorlund: Thank you. Your Shield-Siblings have withdrawn to the Underforge. I         think they're waiting for you.",
"Vilkas: The old man had one wish before he died. And he didn't get it. It's as        simple as that.",
"Aela: Being moon-born is not so much of a curse as you might think, Vilkas.",
"Vilkas: That's fine for you. But he wanted to be clean. He wanted to meet        Ysgramor and know the glories of Sovngarde. But all that was taken        from him.",
"Aela: And you avenged him.",
"Farkus: Kodlak did not care for vengeance.",
"Vilkas: No, Farkus, he didn't. And that's not what this is about. We should be        honoring Kodlak, no matter our own thoughts on the blood.",
"Aela: You're right. It's what he wanted, and he deserved to have it.",
"Vilkas: Kodlak used to speak of a way to cleanse his soul, even in death. You        know the legends of the Tomb of Ysgramor.",
"Aela: 'There the souls of the Harbingers will heed the call of northern steel.'      We can't even enter the tomb without Wuuthrad, and it's in pieces, like      it has been for a thousand years.",
"Eorlund: And dragons were just stories. And the elves once ruled Skyrim. Just         because something is, doesn't mean it must be. The blade is a weapon.         A tool. Tools are made to be broken...and repaired.",
"Vilkas: Is that...? Did you repair the blade?",
"Eorlund: This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our         Shield-Brother here. 'The flames of a hero can reforge the shattered.'         The flames of Kodlak shall fuel the rebirth of Wuuthrad. And now it         will take you to meet him once more. As the one who bore the         fragments, I think you should be the one to carry Wuuthrad into         battle. The rest of you, prepare to journey to the Tomb of Ysgramor.         For Kodlak.",
"Vilkas: This is the resting place of Ysgramor. And his most trusted generals.        You should be careful.",
"Are you not coming?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Kodlak was right. I let vengeance rule my heart. I regret nothing of         what we did at Driftshade. But I can't go any further with my mind         fogged or my heart grieved.",
"Why do we need to be cautious?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         The original Companions. Their finest warriors rest with Ysgramor.         You'll have to prove yourselves to them. It's not that you're         intruding; I wager they've actually expected us. They just want to be         sure that you're worthy. Be ready for an honorable battle.",
"How do we get inside?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Return Wuuthrad to Ysgramor. He should open the way.",
"Farkas: I can't go any further, Shield-Brother.",
"Dragonborn: What's the matter?",
"Farkas: Ever since Dustman's Cairn, the big crawly ones have been too much for        me. Everyone has his weakness, and this one is mine. I'm not proud, but        I will stay back with Vilkas. Give my regards to Ysgramor.",
"Kodlak: Greetings, Shield-Brother.",
"Dragonborn: Kodlak, is that you?",
"Kodlak: Of course. My fellow Harbingers and I have been warming ourselves here.        Trying to evade Hircine.",
"Dragonborn: But there's nobody else here.",
"Kodlak: You see only me because your heart knows only me as the Companions        leader. I'd wager old Vignar could see half a dozen of my predecessors.        And I see them all. The ones in Sovngarde. The ones trapped with me in        Hircine's realm. And they all see you. You've brought honor to the name        of the Companions. We won't soon forget it.",
"Dragonborn: Vilkas said you could still be cured.",
"Kodlak: Did he now? I can only hope. You still have the witches' heads?        Excellent. Throw one of them into the fire. It will release their        magic, for me at least.",
"Dragonborn: We've killed your beast spirit.",
"Kodlak: And so slain the beast inside of me. I thank you for this gift. The        other Harbingers remain trapped by Hircine, though. Perhaps from        Sovngarde, the rest of the heroes of old can aid me in their rescue.        The Harrowing of the Hunting Grounds. It would be a battle of such        triumph. And perhaps someday, you'll join us in that battle. But for        today, return to Jorrvaskr. Triumph in your victory. And lead the        Companions to further glory.",
"Aela: Did I hear right? Did he say you were to lead the Companions?",
"He did indeed.      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       You've earned the right. Your strength and honor are apparent to all.",
"Does this upset you?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       I'm just surprised. But your strength and honor are apparent to all.",
"And it's my honor to be first to address you as Harbinger. Let's go tell      the others.",

"What sort of dog?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        I don't know really.",
"The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was       hoping you'd seen it. I guess I'll stay on the lookout. Keep your nose       clean while you're here, outsider.",

"No, sorry. I didn't see a dog.     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯      There's one out on the road.",
"The guard at the gate mentioned a dog.²     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯      I asked the gate guards to look for him.",

"Barbas: You are exactly what I was looking for.",
"You were looking for me?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Yeah, I think you'll be just what I need.",

They were suffering so from vampirism, and begged me for a cure.          Then you came and ended their misery! I couldn't have planned it          better myself. So, what's your heart's desire?

Haven't you already killed enough of your foes             using the more mundane means at your disposal? Swords, magic,             etc.? How...uninspired. As much as I hate to say it, you're almost             as powerful as I am right now. But that's just because half of my             power resides in that mutt, Barbas. Come to think of it, I know of             a win-win situation for both of us.",
"Dragonborn: What's your offer?",
"Clavicus: There's an axe. An incredible powerful axe. An axe powerful enough          for me to have quite a bit of fun, indeed. If you bring it to me,          I'll grant you my boon. No strings attached. No messy surprises. At          least, not for you. As I recall, it's resting in Rimerock Burrow.          Barbas can lead you right to it. The little mutt might even earn          his place back at my side.",
"Dragonborn: What did you want, again?",
"Clavicus: In Rimerock Burrow, there's an artifact called the Rueful Axe. Bring          it to me, and I'll take Barbas back. Simple as that.",
"Dragonborn: So what's the story behind the Rueful Axe.",
"Barbas: One of Clavicus's little jests. A wizard named Sebastian Lort had a        daughter who worshipped Hircine. When the daughter became a werewolf        it drove Sebastian over the edge. He couldn't stand to see his little        girl take on such a bestial form. The wizard wished for the ability to        end his daughter's curse. Clavicus gave him an axe.",
"Clavicus: Ah, you've got the axe! And my dog. Splendid.",
"Dragonborn: We're back. Now fulfill your end of the bargain.",
"Clavicus: Excellent work. A hero and his faithful companion, retrieving the          ancient artifact for the prince. It's almost...storybook. Ah, but          it almost seems a shame to give a weapon like that away, doesn't it?          I suppose I could be persuaded to let you keep it... But only if you          use the axe to kill Barbas. Simple as that.",
"No deal. Take the axe and take back Barbas!          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Hrmph. You're not fun at all. Guess I'll have to make my own fun           elsewhere. And with the pup back, I'll be restored to my full power.           There's a whole world just waiting for me!",
"Barbas: Wait a second, there's another option here.",
"Dragonborn: I think I want to keep the axe.",
"Barbas: The axe isn't the only item dear old Clavicus has. Give him the Rueful        Axe and once we're reunited the Masque of Clavicus Vile will be yours.",
"Dragonborn: He's dead. Are we done here?",
"Clavicus: Absolutely! Now I can reabsorb his body, and return to full power.          All without having to listen to his whining! Oh, sure, he'll be back          in a century or two, but think of the fun I can have 'til then.          Enjoy that axe! And don't worry about poor old Barbas. After all, he          really should have picked a better friend...",
"Barbas: I knew I could trust you.",
"Clavicus: Yeah, yeah, dog gets master, master gets cosmic axe, everyone's          happy. Just get over here, mutt.",
"Barbas: Don't worry, I'll make sure he sees the light. I trusted you, now you        trust me.",
"Clavicus: Ah, that feels so much better! You forget how nice supreme power          feels until you've been stuck in a cave for a few years.",
"Oh, fine. Have my boon and be done with it. I've got more interesting          deals to make anyway.",
"Sam: If you're looking for a challenge, you've come to the right place. A few     drinks, a few laughs and a contest. What could be better?",
"Here we go.      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       One down, my friend. One down.",
"This was a bad idea.      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Sorry to hear that.",
"Sam: And another one for me. And how about you?",
"Dragonborn: One more. No problemsh.",
"Sam: Wow. You've really done it. The staff is yours.",
"Dragonborn: Thash grape!",
"Sam: You know, you're a fun person to drink with. I know this great little     place where the wine flows like water. We should head there. Hey, you     don't look so good...",
"Senna: Wake up! That's right, it's time to wake up, you drunken blasphemer!",
"Where am I?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Of course! You don't remember getting here.",
"Blasphemer?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        I see. So you don't remember fondling the statuary, then?",
"Unh, my head.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Yes, your head hurts and you don't remember where you are.",
"Was a man named Sam with me?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Dibella teaches love and compassion, but that doesn't mean we're just        going to tell you what you want to know and let you walk away from        this. Pick up your mess, then apologize, and if we think you're sincere        we'll consider lending you aid.",
"Tell me how I got here and I'll pay for the damages. (### gold)       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        • Well, we can always use contributions. You were ranting but most of          it was slurred. You did say something about Rorikstead. Maybe you          should take a look there.",
"Senna: I suppose that'll do. Dibella teaches us forgiveness, after all. Even       for a drunk like you.",
"Dragonborn: So do you remember anything I said when I got here?",
"Senna: You were ranting when you got here, but most of it was slurred. You       did say something about Rorikstead. Maybe you should take a look there.",
"Ennis: You! You've got a lot of nerve showing yourself in this town again. What       do you have to say for yourself?",
"You'd better remember her right fast, before I call the guards and have       you hauled away.",
"Dragonborn: That sounds pretty bad...",
"Ennis: You're damned right it does. I'll never breed another prize-winning goat       like Gleda! And don't you think of coming back to Rorikstead until you       get her back from that Giant.",
"What happened with Gleda again? I'm a little fuzzy on that.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        You really don't remember stealing a goat and selling her to a Giant?        Are you thick? Go get her! At least she's bound to follow you back --        you smell just like the fermented feed she likes.",
"Did I say anything about where I left a staff?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        You mentioned something like that... when you were running off with my        goat! Tell you what -- you bring back my goat, and maybe I'll give a        damn about your staff.",
"Help me retrace my steps and I'll pay you for the goat. (1000 gold)       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        • Fine, but I'll still be missing my Gleda. Doubt I'll ever have a          prize winning¹ goat again. Most of what you said was gibberish but          you left a note. The only bit I could read was 'after repaying Ysolda          in Whiterun.'",
"Tell me everything and you won't end up like your goat. (Intimidate)       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        • Okay, okay. Most of what you said didn't make sense but you left a          note. The only bit that I could read said 'after repaying Ysolda in          Whiterun.' That's all I know.",
"Dragonborn: Here's your goat. Now can you help me retrace my steps?",
"Ennis: Gleda! And not a scratch on her! Happy day! I still can't figure out       why you stole her. You left a note explaining it, but half of it was       gibberish and the rest had mead spilled on it. Only bit I could make out       was 'repaying Ysolda in Whiterun,' and even that's mostly scribbles.       Guess you could try there.",
"Ysolda: So, you're finally back. Look, I've been patient, but you still owe me.",
"Okay, how much do I owe you?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         It's not about the money, really. I wouldn't have given you the         wedding ring on credit if you weren't so obviously in love. But if         there isn't going to be a wedding, the least you can do is give the         ring back. That was one of my best pieces.",
"Yeah, I've been getting that a lot.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Aw, what's wrong? Did the engagement fall through? Look, how about we         call it even, as long as you bring back the wedding ring? That's         really a shame -- I was so looking forward to the wedding. You said         you'd have all the most interesting guests.",
"Dragonborn: Do you know what I did with it?",
"Ysolda: You went right out to give it to your fiancee¹! Don't you even remember        where you left her? And after you told me that sweet story of how you        met in Witchmist Grove! I can see why she left you.",
"Seriously, let me pay you for the ring. (2000 gold)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • Decided to go through with it then? I knew you couldn't have           forgotten about your fiance¹. You spoke of her so glowingly. I don't           know much about Morvunskar but it sounded like a lovely place for           the ceremony. Congratulations.",
"What was that story about my fiancee¹?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         How could you forget? It was the sweetest story I'd ever heard. You         met at the full moon, under the biggest tree in Witchmist Grove,         surrounded by fireflies. It was straight out of a storybook.",
"Moira: Darling! I've been waiting for you to return, to consummate our love!",
"Moira: What? You want it for that hussy Esmerelda, with the dark feathers –-       don't you? I won't let her have you!",
"Ysolda:",
"Sam: You're here! I was beginning to think you might not make it.",
"Dragonborn: It was quite a trip. Where are we?",
"Sam: I thought you might not remember your first trip here. You had a big     night. I think you've definitely earned the staff.",
"Dragonborn: I have all the things needed to repair it.",
"Sam: Oh, the Hagraven feather and so on. You can throw all those out. You     see...",
"Sanguine: I really just needed something to encourage you to go out into the          world and spread merriment. And you did just that! I haven't been so          entertained in at least a hundred years!",
"So all of this was just a prank?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Just a prank? Just a prank? The Daedric Lord of Debauchery does not           deal in mere 'pranks.' This may have begun as a minor amusement, but           it wasn't long before I realized you'd make a more interesting           bearer of my not-quite-holy staff.",
"Who are you?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I am Sanguine, Daedric Prince of Debauchery! I know, I know, how           could I lie to you? Well, how could I trust you until we've shared           a few drinks? But it wasn't long before I realized you'd make a more           interesting bearer of my not-quite-holy staff than this waste of           flesh.",
"Thanks, I guess.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           My pleasure. But I think it's time for you to go. No fun keeping you           locked up in here with the staff.",
"Why did you choose me?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Let's be honest, here. I don't always think my decisions through.           But you...you're going places. Maybe a little influence from your           old uncle Sanguine could help adjust your course a bit...",
"Priestess: We are Lord Boethiah's faithful. Have you come to test your mettle?",
"Is this some kind of cult?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            We are forged by Boethiah's example. We carve our will upon the            world through our tongues and our blades. You? You are nothing.            An empty vapor, dispersed by the slightest breeze.",
"Who is Boethiah?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            The Lord of Plots, Deceiver of Nations, Devourer of Trinimac. The            Queen of Shadows, Goddess of Destruction, He-Who-Destroys and            She-Who-Erases... Many are our lord's lofty names, but they befit            only us mortals. Intone her mighty names from now until the end            of time -- it is for naught. Names mean nothing to our Lord. She            only cares for those who care for themselves, whose hearts are            full of purpose, whose lives are full of deeds.",
"My heart is full of purpose, and my life is full of deeds.            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             If you desire a glimpse of our Dark Mistress, then this is what             you must do. First, prove your tongue can wield a lie. Find             someone. Gain his trust. Lead him to the shrine above. Next,             instruct your thrall to touch the Pillar of Sacrifice. Its magic             will ensnare him, rendering him helpless. Then, girded with             certitude, plant the ceremonial blade deeply, so that the waters             of his heart wash over you. If your will is strong enough, it             will stir Boethiah in her Dark Mansion, and she will appear before             us.",
"Boethiah: Ahhhhgh. Wearing flesh is so...distasteful. You have caught my          attention, mortal. That is most unwise. Tell me, why have you slain          those who profess to follow in my ways?",
"Dragonborn: My reasons are my own.",
"Boethiah: I abide only those whose will is aligned with my own. Those who          oppose my desires perish in the most dreadful of ways. I have a          purpose for which you might prove useful. But first I must test the          deftness of your guile, and the strength of your purpose. Make a          thrall. Lure him to my shrine. Prove your will is stronger. Convince          him to embrace the Pillar of Sacrifice, and then slay him without          mercy. Do this and I shall remember you and bestow an important task          upon you. Do this not, and I shall forget you, and your soul will          waste in obscurity.",
"Boethiah: Ahhhhgh. Wearing flesh is so...distasteful. You have caught my          attention, mortal. That is most unwise. Tell me, why have you slain          this one, who trusted you, here upon my shrine?",
"Who are you?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I am called Boethiah. Many names have mortals given to me. But I am           not interested in names. I am interested only in deeds.",
"Are you some kind of god?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            A god? Assuredly not! When was the last time you saw evidence of            Aedra in the world? No, we Daedra are more powerful than any god.            And among my brethren, I am the most feared.",
"My reasons are my own.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Indeed. But I abide only those whose will is aligned with my own.           Those who oppose my desires perish in the most dreadful of ways.",
"Listen. All of you! Hear me! I have need of a warrior. Only the most          ruthless, cunning, and agile will do. You have gathered here night          after night, sacrificing fools upon my shrine, and sparring aimlessly          with yourselves. But which among you truly exceeds the rest? Prove          yourselves to me! I have a special task for whichever of you is left          standing.",
"Boethiah: Well done. You have proven the strength of your will and your          tongue's gift for lies. You have shown ferocity and prowess in          combat. Now the time has come for a final proving. Are you able to          cast aside your honor and strike with the hidden blade?",
"My previous champion displeases me. It is time he is replaced -- in          the traditional fashion.",
"Who is he?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I am loath to utter his name...one cannot erase a thing if it has a           name to be remembered.",
"Where can I find him?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           You will find him holed up at Knifepoint Ridge, where he plays king           to bandits and highwaymen.",
"What has he done to displease you?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           For a time he served his purpose, but that time has ended. He uses           my gifts for his own amusement, and the only amusement I tolerate           is my own.",
"Say no more. He's as good as dead.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Kill every single member of his band. Do so as silently and           invisibly as you can, for this is not about you. You are to be my           instrument in this. Slay him in the coldest of blood. Do not give           him the dignity of defending himself. Once his corpse lays cold           upon the ground, and all trace of his followers erased, retrieve           my Ebony Mail. A gift fit only for my true champion.",
"Boethiah: You have done well, my Champion. You have earned my respect, a feat          few manage and live to tell about. I shall write your name upon the          Tablet of Absolute Darkness. You may keep my Ebony Mail, a token of          my appreciation to my new champion. Its gifts will resonate with          your talents. Now go. I have strings to pull that require my full          attention. You may pursue your own course wherever it leads you.          Remember always this: As you will, so it shall be.",
"Aranea: Azura has seen your coming, traveler. It was not curiosity, but fate,        that has lead you here.",
"What is this place? Who's Azura?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         This shrine was built by the Dunmer. As our land was scorched by fire         and brimstone, Azura's prophecies led us to safety. She is a Daedra,         a powerful being who watches from beyond our mortal plane. She has         chosen you to be her champion.",
"Very well. What does Azura need?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         You must go to a fortress, endangered by water, yet untouched by it.         Inside, you will find an elven mage who can turn the brightest star         as black as night. It is crytic, I know, but Azura's signs are never         wrong. I believe the fortress may refer to Winterhold. Ask if they         know this elven enchanter.",
"Twilight guide your path.",
"Dragonborn: I'd like to know more about Azura.",
"Aranea: She is the Goddess of Dawn and Dusk. Azura sees into the Twilight of        the future, and guides her followers through it.",
"Dragonborn: Where did this shrine come from?",
"Aranea: My people, the Dunmer, built it. We fled from Morrowind after        Vvardenfell erupted almost 200 years ago. Those of us who were        faithful to Azura were given a vision that led us away from the island        before the worst came. This shrine is our thanks to her. That none will        forget she watches over us all.",
"Dragonborn: Are you all alone here?",
"Aranea: Yes. There were others at first, but Azura's visions tested everyone's        faith. One by one, they left. Afraid to know their own future. But I        refused to abandon the shrine. The visions are a gift. Azura warns me        of tragedy, war, death before it happens. I won't leave her guidance.",
"Dragonborn: Is there an elven mage here that studies stars?",
"Dagur: The Mages are up in the college. You can ask them, if they'll let you       in. Then again, Nelacar might know. He's an old-timer from the College,       but he has a room here.",
"Nelacar: I don't deal with any College applicants these days, so don't bother         asking.",
"Dragonborn: I'm looking for an elven mage who studies stars.",
"Nelacar: Who sent you? Was it the College? The Jarl? We agreed there would be         no more questions.",
"Look, I'm willing to pay. (### gold)         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          • A few coins for my soul? If only you understood the irony.          • I don't think you understand. I'm not answering questions.",
"Nelacar: What do you know about soul gems?",
"They're for enchanting, correct?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          They are. Except the gem is always consumed. They're frail. Except          for one.",
"Soul gems? Why are you asking?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          That's what caused all the trouble. Soul gems are used in enchanting,          but they break afterwards. Except one.",
"Don't change the subject.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Soul gems are the subject, friend. They're used in enchanting, then          they break. Except one.",
"Azura's Star. A Daedric artifact that allows any number of souls to         pass through it. Some of us wanted to find out how. I was working         under Malyn Varen, then. If only we knew what he was really planning.",
"Get to the point.          What did Malyn do?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Malyn wanted to alter the Star. He was dying. Disease. He thought he           could store his own soul inside. Become immortal. It drove him mad.           Students started dying. Eventually, the College exiled him. He took           a few loyal disciples to Ilinalta's Deep and vanished.",
"Look, I don't care who asked you to find the Star, but don't take it          back to Azura. The Daedra are evil. They're the reason Malyn went          insane.",
"Dragonborn: How does Azura's Star work?",
"Nelacar: I mentioned how the Star is a soul gem, only it never gets depleted?         There's another rule the artifact follows. You can only store white         souls in the Star, belonging to the lesser creatures. Azura's magic         won't allow black souls to enter it. As a mortal, Malyn's soul was         black, so part of his work was breaking past Azura's rules. He was         close before...well, I already told you.",
"Dragonborn: How did the Daedra drive Malyn insane?",
"Nelacar: Azura is no ordinary Daedra. She commands an entire realm in of         Oblivion. The more Malyn worked on the Star, the more she was able to         damn him. It started slowly at first. Malyn would see things that         weren't there. Then he would yell at students over words they hadn't         said. Then one day I walked in and Malyn had...killed a student, and         in a horrific moment of inspiration, he started using her soul for his         work.",
"Dragonborn: It sounds like Malyn got what was coming to him.",
"Nelacar: The College would agree with you, but do you have any idea how many         innocent lives were cut short, just so Azura could have revenge? We're         nothing to the Daedra. Pawns to move around, praise, and punish as         they see fit.",
"Nelocar: Stendarr's Mercy. You found it. Azura's Star. Maybe this is my chance         to make things right. I can finish Malyn's work, the way we had meant         to before his madness. It would mean cutting the Star off from Azura.         Only black soul would be able to enter it once we finished.",
"Let's do it.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Give me a minute to examine the Star. I'll see what we need to do.",
"These fissures and cracks aren't encouraging. Malyn was obviously         growing more desperate once he left the College. He did it. He         actually managed to trap his own soul inside the Star, but it's         falling apart. It needs more and more souls to sustain itself. The         Star is being used to sustain Malyn's soul. I can't fix it while that         fragment of him is inside.",
"So we need to deal with Malyn somehow.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Precisely. But it's not as simple as enchanting Malyn away. He's put          up barriers. Souls are only allowed in, not out. If we were to...          somehow...send a soul inside the Star. One that was ready to          overpower Malyn from the inside...",
"You want to send my soul inside, don't you?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           A special type of soul trap. Placing you within the Star without           fully killing you. Once Malyn has been dealt with, I'll bring you           back.",
"Won't that kill him?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          He's already dead. Worse, the enchantment keeping him intact requires          black souls. I don't know how many people he must have killed. If we          don't do something, the enchantment will eventually fade, and the          Star will slip back into Oblivion. Azura will have the last laugh.",
"Dragonborn: What do I do once I'm inside?",
"Nelacar: Malyn's soul should be in the Star. Theoretically, purging him will         be just like killing a ghost anywhere else. I'll have a magical tether         to your soul while you're inside. Once you're done, it'll be as simple         as pulling you back into your body.",
"Dragonborn: What's to keep me from ending up like Malyn?",
"Nelacar: Malyn's soul is beyond home because his body is dead. But I'll be         keeping you just slightly alive on this end. But be careful. If you         die inside the Star, your soul will be disrupted. There's nothing         anyone can do for you if that happens.",
"Dragonborn: I'm ready to enter the Star.",
"Nelacar: Okay. Stand still. This might sting. First, I'll need to grab hold of         your soul. Now, take a deep breath.",
"Malyn: Ah, my disciples have sent me a fresh soul. Good. I was getting...       hungry. Wait. There's something different about you.",
"This experiment of yours is over!       You can't escape your fate, Malyn.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        And who are you to challenge me? I have conquered mortality itself.        I've spat in the eyes of the Daedric Lords. This is my realm now. I've        sacrificed too much for let you take it from me!",
"Malyn: No. Not like this.",
"Nelacar: Malyn's enchantments are broken. Hold on. I'm going to pull your soul         out of there. Brace yourself.",
"Nelacar: Easy there. The numbness will pass. Just don't strain yourself. We've         done it. The Star has been cut from Azura, and Malyn's soul finally         has some measure of peace, even if it is in non-existence.",
"What do we do with it now?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Now? You could use it for what we meant it for. Using black souls          for enchanting. The Black Star will never decay, but it can no longer          hold the white souls of lesser creatures. You keep it.",
"If it's fixed, then it's mine.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Go ahead. Take it.",
"Aranea: Azura's Star! I knew the Lady of Twilight had sent you for a reason.        Hand it over to me. I will ask Azura to restore teh Star to its        original purity.",
"Here. Take it.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I will commune with Azura.",
"Aranea: Azura. Mother of Roses. Goddess of Dusk and Dawn. Your chosen champion        has returned your Star to you. She wishes to speak to you herself.        Please. Place your hands on the altar, and you will hear her voice.",
"Azura: Greetings, mortal. You have followed my guidance through the veils of       Twilight and rescued my Star from Malyn Varen. But his soul still       resides within, protected by enchantments. Until he is purged, my       artifact is useless to you.",
"Is there any way to cleanse the Star?       Then why don't you remove it? Aren't you a daedra?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Eventually, the Star will fade into my realm in Oblivion, but I doubt        you have the hundred or so years it would take to wait. No, only one        option remains. I will send you inside the Star. You will banish        Malyn's soul there. Tell me when you are ready, mortal.",
"Dragonborn: I'm ready to enter the Star.",
"Azura: Have faith, mortal. I will be watching over you.",
"Azura: The Star is free to purify itself. Don't worry, mortal. I will return       you before you are cleansed.",
"Azura: My Star has been restored and Malyn's soul has been consigned to       Oblivion. You have done well, mortal. As was destined, you are free to       use my Star as you see fit.",
"Thank you, Lady Azura.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Farewell, mortal. Know that Azura will be guarding over the threads of        your fate in the Twilight.",
"Aranea: While you were in the Star, Azura gave me a vision. Her last, she said.        I have never been without Azura's guidance since escaping Morrowind. I        don't know what to do. If you need me, I'd be honored to accompany you,        Guardian of the Star. It would give me a purpose.",
"Thank you, Aranea.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Twilight watch over you, Guardian.",
"What use would you be?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I was a sorceress of no small skill before I came into Azura's faith.         Afterwards, her magic sustained me. I could easily provide my spells         to your cause. Protect you from harm. Defeat your enemies.",
"So, Azura isn't giving you any more visions?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         No. She said my part was over. That my fate had moved beyond the         Twilight, and I was on my own. I will tend Azura's shrine when you do         not need me. I still have my duties, but for the first time I feel...         alone.",
"Meridia: A new hand touches the Beacon. Listen. Hear me and obey. A foul         darkness has seeped into my temple. A darkness that you will destroy.",
"Meridia: You have found my beacon. But it is not time for rejoicing. The         defiler continues to profane my temple. Return to my figure on Mount         Kilkreath, and I shall make you the instrument of my cleansing light.",
"Meridia: A new supplicant approaches. Listen. Hear me and obey. A foul darkness         has seeped into my temple. A darkness that you will destroy. But         first, you must restore to me my beacon. I shall guide you unto it.         Find it and return here. And great shall be your reward.",
"Meridia: Look at my temple, lying in ruins. So much for the constancy of         mortals, their crafts and their hearts. If they love me not, how can         my love reach them?",
"Meridia: It is time for my splendor to return to Skyrim. But the token of my         truth lies buried in the ruins of my once great temple, now tainted         by a profane darkness skittering within. The Necromancer Malkoran         defiles my shrine with vile corruptions, trapping lost souls left in         the wake of this war to do his bidding. Worse still, he uses the power         stored within my own token to fuel his foul deeds. I have brought you         here, mortal, to be my champion. You will enter my temple, retrieve my         artifact, and destroy the defiler.",
"Tell me more about this artifact.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Mortals call it Dawnbreaker, for it was forged in a holy light that          breaks upon my foes, burning away corruption and false life. You will          enter my shrine, destroy Malkoran, and retrieve this mighty blade.",
"It doesn't really sound like I have a choice in the matter.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          But a single candle can banish the darkness of the entire Void. If          not you, then someone else. My beacon is sure to attract a worthy          soul. But if you are wise, you will heed my bidding.",
"Go now, the artifact my be reclaimed and Malkoran destroyed. Malkoran         has forced the doors shut. But this is my temple, and it responds to         my decree. I will send down a ray of light. Guide this light through         my temple and its doors will open.",
"Meridia: It is done. The defiler is defeated. Take Dawnbreaker from its         pedestal.",
"Meridia: Malkoran is vanquished. Skyrim's dead shall remain at rest. This is         as it should be. This is because of you. A new day is dawning. And         you shall be its herald. Take the mighty Dawnbreaker and with it         purge corruption from the dark corners of the world. Wield it in my         name, that my influence may grow.",
"Ugor: Halt! You have no business here, outsider. Leave at once.",
"Lob: By the Ashpit, we can't go on like this.",
"Atub: Forgive Ugor's harsh words. She is merely doing as she has been told.",
"What's going on here?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       ---",
"It seems like I shouldn't be here.      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       No, don't go!",
"Please, our tribe suffers and we need help. Our chief, Yamarz, was once      a strong and proud warrior. Now he is stricken, cursed. He is weak, so      our tribe is weak. The giants sense this, and intrude on our territory.      Now they assault our very home. Yamarz refuses help, but I sense you may      be just what we need.",
"What can I do?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Yamarz has demanded we stay inside the walls. We cannot leave. I must       petition Malacath for relief. This curse must be lifted. But I cannot       travel to Malacath's shrine. The ritual must be done here, and I do not       have the materials I need. I beg of you, can you bring me Troll Fat and       a Daedra Heart? I have no wish to depend on a stranger, but I have no       choice.",
"Deal with your own curses.      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       We have been on our own for some time now. I fear we will not survive.",
"Dragonborn: Here are the things you asked for.",
"Atub: Excellent. Now, you must come with me. You've become a part of this. You      must be present for the ritual.",
"Atub: It is time, Yamarz.",
"Yamarz: You bring an outsider here, and now insist I call on Malacath for help,        when he has clearly forsaken me? You try my patience, Atub.",
"Atub: Doing nothing will not grant our tribe relief from this curse. We must      try.",
"Yamarz: Grrr. Fine, let's get this over with.",
"Atub: Now, we begin the ritual... Great Malacath, we beseech you, aid us in      our time of need...",
"Yamarz: Why are we bothering with this?",
"Malacath: You pathetic weakling!",
"Yamarz: What's that?",
"Atub: Malacath has heard my pleas! He speaks to us!",
"Malacath: You dare summon me, Yamarz?",
"Yamarz: What? What is this?",
"Malacath: You don't deserve to call yourself an Orc! You're weak, you're small,          and you're an embarrassment. You let giants...Giants!...overrun my          shrine! Bring me their leader's club, as an offering and I might          release you from this curse!",
"Atub: So it will be. Malacath has spoken, Yamarz. Your path is clear.",
"Yamarz: Very well. You, outsider, come here! I want a word. This is all your        fault, you know. I'm stuck fighting a giant, thanks to you. So you're        going to help me. You're going with me, and you're going to make sure        I don't have any trouble reaching that giant. Don't worry, I'll make        it worth your while.",
"Fighting the giant isn't my job.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Thanks to you, I've been issued a challenge in front of my whole         tribe, by a Daedric Prince, no less. I can't ignore that. I didn't         say I wouldn't fight the giant. I just said you're going to help me         get to it. Meet me outside Fallowstone Cave. You clear the way to the         giant for me, and I'll make sure you get paid for it.",
"What do you want me to do?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         This giant... It's not the only thing in Fallowstone Cave. Getting to         it isn't going to be easy. You're going to clear a path to the giant,         so I can conserve my strength. I'll make sure you're paid for it. So,         you meet me at Fallowstone Cave, and I'll get this over with. I can         have my tribe back, and you can... You can leave us alone.",
"Yamarz: Let's just get this over with.",
"How long has this been going on?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Weeks? Longer? it feels like an age has gone by. I haven't slept in         so long.",
"Let's get this over with.",
"Yamarz: All right, I'll go kill this giant. Unless, of course, you'd like to        make some extra gold.",
"What do you mean?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I'm tired, I haven't slept well in weeks. You kill the giant, bring         me the hammer. We go back to Largashbur, I tell everyone I did it.         You keep your mouth shut, and I pay you. Handsomely.",
"Okay, I'll do it.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Good. I'll be waiting right here.",
"No, you're supposed to do it.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Fine, then wait here. This should only take a second.",
"Yamarz: Excellent work. You have a true fighting spirit. Did that better than        I could have. Of course, I can't let you leave here alive. Wouldn't        want anyone finding out.",
"Malacath: Yamarz was a fool. Always trying to scheme his way out of          responsibility. But, you took care of him and the giants. Two          problems solved at once. Now, take Shagrol's hammer back to          Largashbur, and we'll see about whipping the rest of them into shape.",
"Atub: Largashbur will not soon forget what you have done. We have a second      chance thanks to you.",
"Dragonborn: I have returned with Shagrol's hammer.",
"Atub: But... What of Yamarz? I see. He did not survive. He... He died well?",
"He fought bravely, but the giant overwhelmed him.      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Ah, that is good to hear, then.",
"He asked me to kill the giant, then attacked me.²      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       What? Why would he do such a thing?",
"Malacath: Yamarz was a coward and a weakling. His deceitful ways have cost you          all greatly.",
"Atub: So he has been punished? And what of us? What fate shall we suffer?",
"Malacath: You'll have to prove yourselves, but I'm willing to give you a          chance. Gularzob's in charge now. Let's hope he's a better chief.          You, place that hammer on the shrine. You're the only one who's          proven worthy in all this...",
"Septimus: Dig, Dwemer, in the beyond. I'll know your lost unknown and rise to          your depths. When the top level was built, no more could be placed.          It was and is the maximal apex.",
"What brings you to this remote place?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           The ice entombs the heart. The bane of Kagrenac and Dagoth Ur. To           harness it is to know. The fundaments. The Dwemer lockbox hides it           from me. The Elder Scroll gives insight deeper than the deep ones,           though. To bring about the opening.",
"You have an Elder Scroll? Here?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            I've seen enough to know their fabric. The warp of air, the weft of            time. But no, it is not in my possession.",
"So, where is the Scroll?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Here. Well, here as in this plane. Mundus. Tamriel. Nearby,           relatively speaking. On the cosmological scale, it's all nearby.",
"Can you help me get the Elder Scroll or not?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            One block lifts another. Septimus will give you what you want, but            you must bring him something in return.",
"Don't make me hurt you. Just tell me where it is.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Oh, a brutish one. Septimus has no fear of you. But as one block            raises another, perhaps ourselves could help us each.",
"Are you...all right?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Oh, I am well. I will be well. Well to be within the will inside the           walls.",
"Dragonborn: What do you want?",
"Septimus: You see this masterwork of the Dwemer. Deep inside their greatest          knowings. Septimus is clever among men, but he is but an idiot child          compared to the dullest of the Dwemer. Lucky then they left behind          their own way of reading the Elder Scrolls. In the depths of          Blackreach one yet lies. Have you heard of Blackreach? 'Cast upon          where Dwemer cities slept, the yearning spire hidden learnings kept.'",
"Dragonborn: Where is this 'Blackreach'?",
"Septimus: Under deep. Below the dark. The hidden keep. Tower Mzark. Alftand.          The point of punture, of first entry, of the tapping. Delve to its          depths, and Blackreach lies just beyond. But not all can enter there.          Only Septimus knows the hidden key to loose the lock to jump beneath          the deathly rock.",
"Dragonborn: How do I get in?",
"Septimus: Two things I have for you. Two shapes. One edged, one round. The          round one, for tuning. Dwemer music is soft and subtle, and needed          to open their cleverest gates. The edged lexicon, for inscribing. To          us, a hunk of metal. To the Dwemer, a full library of knowings.          But...empty. Find Mzark and its sky-dome. The machinations there          will read the scroll and lay the lore upon the cube. Trust Septimus.          He knows you can know.",
"Dragonborn: What do I do with this sphere?",
"Septimus: The deepest doors of Dwemer listen for singing. It plays the attitude          of notes proper for opening. Can you not hear it? Too low for          hearings?",
"Dragonborn: What do I do with this cube?",
"Septimus: To glimpse the world inside an Elder Scroll can damage the eyes. Or          the mind, as it has to Septimus. The Dwemer found a loophole, as they          always do. To focus the knowledge away and inside without harm. Place          the lexicon into their contraption and focus the knowings into it.          When it brims with glow, bring it back and Septimus can read once          more.",
"Dragonborn: What do you want with the Elder Scroll?",
"Septimus: Ooooh, an observant one. How clever to ask of Septimus. This Dwemer          lockbox. Look upon it and wonder. Inside is the heart. The heart of          a god! The heart of you. And me. But it was hidden away. Not by the          Dwarves, you see. They were already gone. Someone else. Unseen.          Unknown. Found the heart, and with a flair for the ironical, used          Dwarven trickery to lock it away. The Scroll will give the deep          vision needed to open it. For not even the strongest machinations of          the Dwemer can hold off the all-sight given by an Elder Scroll.",
"Dragonborn: What is an Elder Scroll?",
"Septimus: You look to your left, you see one way. You look to your right, you          see another. But neither is any harder than the opposite. But the          Elder Scrolls...they look left and right in the stream of time. The          future and past are as one. Sometimes they even look up. What do they          see then? What if they dive in? Then the madness begins.",
"Umana: Sulla, let's just get out of here. Hasn't there been enough death?",
"Sulla: Oh, of course you want me to leave. Just waiting for me to turn my back!       So you can have all the glory for yourself!",
"Dragonborn: I've inscribed the lexicon.",
"Septimus: Give it, quickly. Extraordinary. I see it now. The sealing structure",
"Dragonborn: Why are you so eager to open the box?",
"Septimus: The box contains a heart. The essence of a god. I have devoted my          life to the Elder Scrolls, but their knowledge is a passing awareness          when compared to the encompassing mind of divinity. The Dwemer were          the last to touch it. It was thought to have been destroyed by the          Nerevarine, but my lord told me otherwise.",
"Dragonborn: Who is your lord?",
"Septimus: The Daedric prince of the unknown. Hermaeus Mora. I thought there          were no secrets left to know. Until I first spoke to him. He asks a          price -- to work his will. A few murders, some dissent spread, a          plague or two. For the secrets I can endure. In time, he brought me          here. To the box. But he won't reveal how to open it. Maddening.",
"Hermaeus Mora: Come closer. Bask in my presence.",
"Dragonborn: Who are you?",
"Hermaeus Mora: I am Hermaeus Mora.",
"Dragonborn: What do you want of me?",
"Hermaeus Mora: Your continuing aid to Septimus renders him increasingly               obsolete. He has served me well, but his time is nearing its               end. Once that infernal lockbox is opened, he will have               exhausted his usefulness to me. When that time comes, you shall               take his place as my emissary. What say you?",
"Dragonborn: I've brought all the blood you require.",
"Septimus: I can almost...hear them. I feel their life energy. Come, I will          make the mixture.",
"Septimus: What is this...it's...it's just a book?! I can see. The world beyond          burns in my mind. It's marvelous...",
"Hermaeus Mora: Come, my champion.",
"What now?               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                ---",
"Now you have my Oghma Infinium. It contains the knowledge of               the ages as revealed to Xarses, my loyal servant. For hundreds               of years it's been shut away from the world. Septimus was a               useful tool for unleashing it. Now it is in your hands. Let us               work wonders together...",
"Tyrannus: Excuse me, but do you know anything about this house? Seen anyone          enter or leave?",
"Why are you asking?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I'm with the Vigil of Stendarr. We believe this house might have           been used for Daedra worship. Evil rites and so forth.",
"No, I haven't.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Seems no one in this city has.",
"Do you need any help?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I was actually just about to head on inside. Be good to have someone           watch my back. Follow me, and keep your eyes open. Daedra are           powerful creatures and tricksters. Never know what you'll find.",
"Sorry. I don't know anything.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Thank you for your time.",
"Tyrannus: Fresh food. No wood rot on the furniture. Someone's been here.          Recently. But the people I asked say no one enters or leaves...          Wait? Did you hear that? I think it came this way. That's it.          Something's inside the house. Come on, we're getting to the bottom          of this. Come out! We know you're here! There's another door. See          if you can get it open.",
"Tyrannus: Stendarr's mercy! This isn't an ordinary Daedra. We have to get help.",
"Tyrannus: You first. Come on, let's go.",
"Tyrannus: Get out of my head, Daedra!",
"Tyrannus: I don't want to die. I can't die here! The Daedra has us. It's you          or me!",
"Molag Bal: Fool! Did you think Molag Bal, the Lord of Domination, would so           easily reward you? What do you see from that little cage? Speak.",
"It's an altar.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Yes. It's an altar. Men would come and sacrifice the wretched in            my name. The weak would be punished by the strong. But a Daedric            Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest            desecrate the altar. Until you came.",
"You want revenge on Boethiah?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Revenge? No. I want submission. I want the priest who did this to            bend his knee and give me his soul. He comes by to perform            Boethiah's insulting rites at my altar, but he's been missing.            Captured and bound. Left to rot. Save him. Let him perform his            rite one more time. And when he does, we will be waiting for him.",
"Logrolf: You there. Are you here to kill me? Slay the mighty Logrolf while he         sits tied and helpless?",
"Boethiah has sent me. (Persuade)          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           • The Dark Mistress? She sent you? Wait. Molag Bal's altar. Of             course. I have to get to Markarth at once. Cut me loose.",
"Does it matter? Here. (### gold)          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           • Fine. I won't ask questions. Cut me loose.           • You think it's money I need? I'm a prisoner, not a beggar.",
"Molag Bal. (Intimidate)          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           • So. The King of Corruption sends his messenger to challenge me.             Very well. I will meet with Molag Bal, and I will venerate his             altar in Boethiah's name, as I did before. Cut me loose, minion             of the Hated One. I need to get to Markarth.",
"Here. Let me untie those binds.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Ah, freedom. Now get out of my way. I have a task to attend to.",
"Wait here a moment.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           That's all I can do, you idiot. What are you waiting for?",
"You'll stay that way for now.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Coward. You're nothing. Nothing!",
"Logrolf: Molag Bal. You think you can best Boethiah's faithful? I have won         this contest before!",
"Molag Bal: Ah. But I have my own champion this time, Logrolf.",
"Logrolf: What? You!",
"Molag Bal: Mortal. I give you my mace, in all its rusted spitefulness. Crush           the spirit from Logrolf's bones. Make him bend to me.",
"Molag Bal: Ah ha ha! You mortals and your frail, limp, pathetic bodies. Try it           again.",
"Logrolf: No more... No more... I submit, Molag Bal. I submit!",
"Molag Bal: You bend to me?",
"Logrolf: Yes!",
"Molag Bal: You pledge your soul to me?",
"Logrolf: Yes!",
"Molag Bal: You forsake the weak and pitiful Boethiah?",
"Logrolf: Yes!",
"Molag Bal: You're mine now, Logrolf. Kill him.",
"Molag Bal: The Mace of Molag Bal! I give you its true power, mortal. When your           enemies lie broken and bloody before you, know that I will be           watching.",
"Thank you, Lord Molag Bal.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Now, I have a soul in Oblivion that needs claiming. Take care of            the house while I'm gone. Ha ha ha!",
"Runil: The god Arkay was once like us, bound to winding mortality. But he       willingly gave up this existence that we might better understand the       vagaries of life and death. It is through the ebb and flow of this       cosmic tide that we find renewal and, in the end, peace. May the spirit       of Lavinia and all those who have left this world and its suffering know       the beloved serenity of Aetherius...and may we one day join them in       eternity.",
"Mathies: A sad time.",
"Dragonborn: Who died?",
"Mathies: Our daughter. Our little girl. She hadn't seen her tenth winter.",
"How did she die?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          She was...he ripped her apart. Like a sabre cat tears a deer. We          barely found enough of her bury.",
"Who did this?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Sinding. Came through as a laborer. Seemed like a decent man. He's          stewing in the pit while we figure out what to do with him, if you've          got the stomach to look at him. What could drive a man to do          something like this? I just don't understand what kind of man does          that.",
"Sinding: Come to gawk at the monster?",
"Dragonborn: I heard you attacked a little girl.",
"Sinding: Believe me, it wasn't anything I ever intended to do. I just...lost         control. I tried to tell them, but none of them believe me. It's all         on account of this blasted ring.",
"Dragonborn: What ring?",
"Sinding: This is the Ring of Hircine. I was told it could let me control my         transformations. Perhaps it used to. But I'll never know. Hircine         didn't care for my taking it, and threw a curse on it. I put it on...         and the changes just came to me. I could never guess when. It would         be at the worst times. Like...with the little girl.",
"Dragonborn: What kind of transformations?",
"Sinding: I don't suppose there's a point in keeping the secret if I'm going to         die in here anyway. I'm sure you've heard of men who shift to beasts         under the influence of the moons. I am one of them. A werewolf. It's         my secret, and my shame. That's why I wanted the ring...it was said         to give men like me control. Now I may look like a man, but I still         feel the animal inside me, as strong as ever.",
"What will you do now?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I've been looking for a way to appease Hircine. There is a certain          beast in these lands. Large, majestic. It's said that Hircine will          commune with whoever slays it. I tracked it into these woods, but          then had my...accident with the child. I want to beg his forgiveness.          Give him back the ring. But while I'm stuck in here, the beast          wanders free.",
"Who is Hircine?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Do you not know the Daedric Lord of the Hunt? He revels in the chase,          and also gave the 'gift' of lycanthropy to mortals. A powerful force,          not to be crossed. As I learned too late.",
"Why did this make you attack the girl?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I had just come into Falkreath. They needed some help working the          mill, and I thought that would be something safe. Something I could          do. When I saw the little girl, I was just...I could feel it coming          on. I could taste the...I needed to hunt. But this pitiful, limited          body wasn't meant for hunting. Slow. No claws. Weak, mashing teeth          for chewing cud. I held in my rage as long as I could. But it boiled          inside of me. She looked so fragile. Helpless prey. And then... I...          I feel terrible about what happened. About what I did. It would          probably be best for everyone if I just went away.",
"Hircine: Well met, hunter.",
"Are you Hircine?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I am the spirit of the hunt, just one glimpse of the glorious stalker          that your kind calls Hircine.",
"What would you ask of me?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Your fealty is precious to me. I will make good use of it. You bear           my ring.",
"Will you remove the curse from this ring?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I may consider it. But you must first do a service for my glory.",
"The one who stole it has fled to what he thinks is his sanctuary.          Just as a bear climbs a tree to escape a hunt, but only ends up          trapping himself. Seek out this rogue shifter. Tear the skin from          his body, and make it an offering to me.",
"It shall be done as you ask.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Fly, my hunter. There are others who vie for my favor. A bit of           competition. Don't dally while the prey flees.",
"He's done me no wrong. I won't kill him.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           There is no retribution in the hunt. It is not vengeance I seek, but           the blood course of a living hunt. There are others who would gladly           accept my favor. They will hunt him while you delay. Your choice.",
"Didn't I just kill you?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          And skillfully, too. I've been watching you for ages, it seems. You          have the makings of a fine hunter. You may even be my champion.          Perhaps.",
"Dragonborn: What happened here?",
"Sinding: ...You! Why?",
"Dragonborn: I've been told to kill you.",
"Sinding: And I would deserve it, wouldn't I? I can't stop you if that's what         you want to do. Hircine is too powerful. But if you spare me, I can         be a powerful ally to you. And I would promise to never return to         civilized life. I know now that I can't live among people.",
"Rissing: What the...we've been betrayed! Look out!",
"Dragonborn: The last of the hunters is dead.",
"Sinding: Thank you for your help. I will make my home here, away from anyone I         might hurt.",
"Hircine: You've done well, hunter.",
"Dragonborn: I did as you asked.",
"Hircine: And found my favor. That skin will serve you well, child. Look more         closely at it. My glories shall protect you from all this world's         grievances. Good hunting.",
"Hircine: Well met again, Hunter.",
"By bringing down my other Hunters, you turned the chase inside out¹.         And they were no base prey. You continue to amuse and impress. Go         forth, with my blessing.",
"Dervenin: Wait, here my plea! My master, he is lost between worlds and I cannot          bring him back!",
"Dragonborn: What do you need?",
"Dervenin: My master has abandoned me! Abandoned his people. And nothing I say          can change his mind. Now he refuses to even see me. He says I          interrupt his vacation! It's been so many years... Won't you please          help?",
"How can I find your master?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Last I saw him, he was visiting a friend in the Blue Palace. But no           one as mundane as the Jarl. No, no...such people are below him. No,           he went into the forbidden wing of the palace, to speak with an old           friend. Said it had been ages since they had last had tea. Oh and           you'll need the hip bone...it's very important. No entering           Pelagius' Wing without that.",
"Why don't you leave your master?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Oh, you just don't understand. Without him, I am not free! Without           him, I am doomed! All of his empire shall fall into chaos...",
"Dragonborn: How can I get to your master?",
"Dervenin: He stays in the Pelagius Wing of the Blue Palace. The doors are          locked, and only Falk Firebeard can grant entry. But I hear the          maids, Una and Erdi, know how to enter it for cleaning. Surely they          can help for such an important matter?",
"Dragonborn: Why do you need him back?",
"Dervenin: Without his guidance, our homeland is falling apart. North wages war          against south! The holy flame flickers and dies! We need his return.          Oh, but...I'm sure he'll repay you when he comes to his senses! His          favor is a powerful, powerful thing. And so very worth any...          inconveniences.",
"Dragonborn: Who is your master?",
"Dervenin: He is a great man, but one rarely praised! He rules twin empires that          span the length and breadth of our minds! All know him, but few can          name him! But...he has forbidden me from saying his name. He says it          distracts him, and woe to those who draw his ire. But you will know          him when you see him. He's the one who made me like this!",
"Una: Got lots of things to take care of. What do you need?",
"Dragonborn: I need to get into the Pelagius Wing.",
"Una: Not on your life. It's dangerous in there, and Falk doesn't even like me     and Erdi going in every year to clean out the spiders.",
"Dragonborn: Falk asked me to check it out.",
"Una: If you really want to... Just be careful of the ghost! He snuck up on me     once and scared me sick. It took me a week for me to feel better... You     can catch me at the Blue Palace later, if you want to talk again.",
"Erdi: Are you my gallant hero? Have you come to whisk me away, to a life of      adventure and romance?",
"Dragonborn: I need to get into the Pelagius Wing.",
"Erdi: Oh, I'd get in trouble for that. It's not allowed. Besides, it's scary      in there!",
"Dragonborn: Falk asked me to check it out.",
"Erdi: Well...I suppose in that case, it's okay to let you in. But only briefly.      Be careful, and come right back!",
"Falk: Absolutely not. That wing has been sealed for hundreds of years, and for      good reason. They say the ghost of Pelagius the Mad still haunts it.      Ghost or not, there are reminders of his dark rule that are best left      buried away.",
"Sheogorath: More tea, Pelly my dear?",
"Pelagius: Oh, I couldn't. Goes right through me. Besides, I have so many things          to do... So many undesirables to contend with. Naysayers. Buffoons.          Detractors. Why, my headsman hasn't slept in three days!",
"Sheogorath: You are far too hard on yourself, my dear, sweet, homicidally            insane Pelagius. What would the people do without you? Dance? Sing?            Smile? Grow old? You are the best Septim that's ever ruled. Well,            except for that Martin fellow, but he turned into a dragon god,            and that's hardly sporting... You know, I was there for that whole            sordid affair. Marvelous time! Butterflies, blood, a Fox, a severed            head... Oh, and the cheese! To die for.",
"Pelagius: Yes, yes, as you've said, countless times before...",
"Sheogorath: Hafrumph! Well then, if you're going to be like that... Perhaps            it's best if I take my leave. A good day to you sir. I said good            day!",
"Pelagius: Yes, yes, go. Leave me to my ceaseless responsibilities and          burdens...",
"Sheogorath: How rude! Can't be bothered to host an old friend for a decade or            two.",
"All I know is that your people need you to return.              ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯               Yaaawwwnn.... Oh, pardon me. Were you saying something? I do               apologize, it's just that I find myself suddenly and               irrevocably... Bored! I mean, really. Here you stand, before               Sheogorath himself, Daedric Prince of Madness, and all you deem               fit to do is...deliver a message? How sad.",
"You're a madman.              ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯               Jolly good guess! But only half right. I'm a mad god. The Mad               God, actually. It's a family title. Gets passed down from me to               myself every few thousand years. Now you. You can call me Ann               Marie. But only if you're partial to being flayed alive and               having an angry immortal skip rope with your entrails. If not...               Then call me Sheogorath, Daedric Prince of Madness. Charmed.",
"Who were you talking to?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             Emperor Pelagius III. Now surely even you know about Pelagius'             decree? On his deathbed -- oh, and this was inspired -- he             forbade...death! That's right! Death! Outlawed!",
"Wait, where are we?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             Inside the mind of Pelagius, silly. Oh. Is it your...first time?",
"Dragonborn: So does that mean you'll leave? Or not?",
"Sheogorath: Now that's the real question, isn't it? Because honestly, how much            time off could a demended Daedra really need? So here's what I'm            going to do. I'm going to leave. That's right. I'm done. Holiday...            complete. Time to return to the hum drum¹ day-to-day. On one            condition. You have to find your way out first. Good luck with            that.",
"Simple.            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             Is it?",
"Okay, what's the catch?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             Ha! I do love it when the mortals know they're being manipulated.             Makes things infinitely more interesting.",
"Care to take a look around? This is not, I dare say, the Solitude            botanical gardens. Have you any idea where you are? Where you truly            are? Welcome to the deceptively verdant mind of Emperor Pelagius            III. That's right! You're in the head of a dead, homicidally insane            monarch. Now, I know what you're thinking. Can I still rely on my            swords and spells and sneaking and all that nonsense? Sure, sure.            Or...you could use...The Wabbajack! Huh? Huh? Didn't see that            coming, did you?",
"Sheogorath: You've headed down the path of dreams. Unfortunately for you,            Pelagius suffered night terrors from a young age. All you need to            do is find something to wake our poor Pelagius up. You'll find his            terrors easy to repel...but persistent.",
"Sheogorath: Well, now that's something to crow about. With Pelagius up and            about you're moving right along. We'll both be home in no time.",
"Sheogorath: Ah, now this is a sad path. Pelagius hated and feared many things.            Assassins, wild dogs, the undead, pumpernickel... But the deepest,            keenest hatred was for himself. The attacks he makes on himself            can be seen here fully. They are always carried out on the weakest            part of his fragile self. The self-loathing enhances Pelagius'            anger! Ah, but his confidence will shrink with every hit. You must            bring the two into balance.",
"Sheogorath: Wonderfully done. Pelagius is finally ready to love himself...and            continue hating everyone else.",
"Sheogorath: Oh, good choice. Well, good for me. I find everyone being out to            get you so terribly entertaining. You might find it...less so. You            see, Pelagius' mother was...well...let us say 'unique.' Although,            I suppose in the grand scheme of things, she was fairly average for            a Septim. That woman wielded fear like a cleaver. Or did she wield            a cleaver and make people afraid? I never get that part right...            Oh, but she taught her son well. Pelagius learned at a very young            age that danger could come from anywhere. At any time. Delivered...            by anyone.",
"Sheogorath: The objective here is simple, you simpleton! Use your Wabbajack to            defeat the enemy, while they do the same!",
"Sheogorath: Oho! I thought you'd never figure it out. With the threat gone,            Pelagius is under the delusion that he is safe, which means you've            helped him out...sort of. And we're that much closer to home.",
"Dragonborn: I've done it. I've fixed Pelagius' mind.",
"Sheogorath: Hmmmm... 'Fixed' is such a subjective term. I think 'treated' is            far more appropriate, don't you? Like one does to a rash, or an            arrow in the face. Ah, but no matter. Heartless mortal that you            are, you've actually succeeded and survived. I am forced to honor            my end of the bargain. So congratulations! You're free to go! I...            have been known to change my mind. So...go. Really.",
"Sheogorath: Pelagius Septim the III, once the Mad Emperor of Tamriel, now so            boringly sane. I always knew he had it in him! Well, I suppose it's            back to the Shivering Isles. The trouble Haskill can get into while            I'm gone simply boggles the mind... Let's make sure I'm not            forgetting anything. Clothes? Check. Beard? Check! Luggage?            Luggage! Now where did I leave my luggage?",
"Dervenin: Master! You've taken me back! Does this mean we're going home? Oh,          happy times! I can't wait to...",
"Sheogorath: Yes, yes, that's quite enough celebration. Let's send you ahead,            shall we?",
"Sheogorath: And as for you, my little mortal minion... Feel free to keep the            Wabbajack. As a symbol of my... Oh, just take the damn thing. You            take care of yourself, now. And if you ever find yourself up in            New Sheoth, do look me up. We can share a strawberry torte. Ha ha!            Ta ta!",
"Kesh: Ah, a wanderer, yes? No? Pilgrim, perhaps? You have come to commune with      Peryite, Taskmaster and blighted Lord, yes?",
"May I commune with Peryite?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Not everyone has the stomach required to entreat my Lord. But Kesh       likes you, friend. There is a way Peryite may speak to us who will take       Him in. If you wish to commune with Him, we'll need the incense.",
"Tell me about this incense.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Yes, the incense. Fetch for me a deathbell flower, one silver ingot,        a flawless ruby, and some vampire dust. Then I will show you how.",
"Tell me about Peryite.      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       He is the pus in the wound. Oh, proper ones curl their noses, but it's       pus that drinks foul humors and restores the blood. I worship Peryite,       yes, because sometimes the world can only be cleansed by disease.",
"Dragonborn: I have the items you requested.",
"Kesh: Ah, have you? Let Kesh have them. Yes, yes. This will create a fine fume.",
"Kesh: That should do. Now -- inhale deeply.",
"Peryite: Breath deep, mortal. I would have you hear me well, so let these         vapors fill your lungs.",
"What do you want with me?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I have watched you for some time, you know. The decisions you've made          intrigue me, and I wonder if you are the proper agent for a task of          mine.",
"What is this? Have I been poisoned?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          In a sense, but no more poisoned than a fool after too much wine.",
"Dragonborn: What task?",
"Peryite: I sent a blessing to Mundus, a wasting plague that infected a         scattering of Breton villages. One of my monks, the elf Orchendor,         was sent to gather these Afflicted. He shepherded them into Bhtardamz         for me, but has since lost his way. I will not stand for betrayal. I         want you to go to Bthardamz and kill Orchendor, in my name.",
"What would I gain from this?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          The pettiness of mortals. I had almost forgotten. I can grant you a          powerful token for this task. An escutcheon of Dwemer make, capable          of shielding you from both the spell and sword. Return when the elf          lies dead and it will be yours.",
"Why does Orchendor deserve to die?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          An impertinent question. The elf must die. Either carry out my will          or do not. You are not the only mortal agent I could choose.",
"Dragonborn: Who is Orchendor?",
"Kesh: Orchendor? Kesh knew him. He's an Overseer. Shepherd. Gathers the      Afflicted, contains the festering wound. Orchendor and his Afficted are      meant to stand ready, awaiting Peryite's command to cover the world with      his blessing.",
"Dragonborn: Where is Bthardamz?",
"Kesh: Not far, not far. This one looks upon it on clear days. Look to the west,      at the foot of the mountain. The Dwarven ruins there. Bthardamz.",
"Peryite: Well done, mortal. All things are in their order, and Orchendor roams         the Pits. His betrayal will be punished, and your obedience is         rewarded.",
"What happens now?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Go, seek your fate. I will be watching, and perhaps we will meet          again -- afterwards.",
"What will become of the Afflicted?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Did you leave any alive? The Afflicted are mere vessels for my          Blessing. It will spread to others through their touch and my own.          Another Overseer will replace Orchendor, when the time comes. For          now all is cleansed and ordered.",
"Very well. Goodbye.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Embrace order and hard truth, mortal. Good bye.",
"Madena: Your ancestors wouldn't want this, Silus!",
"Silus Vesuius: Why should I hide from it? This is my family's legacy!",
"Madena: It's the past! Dead oaths on dead lips. Let it stay there.",
"Silus: The museum is opening, Madena.",
"Silus: And here comes my first visitor. The Museum of the Mythic Dawn is open,       friend!",
"Museum of the Mythic Dawn?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Yes. My collection of artifacts from a group that toppled an Empire.",
"What was that argument about?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Never mind that. Madena is a good woman, but I have my own reasons for        opening this museum, and I'm not changing my mind. I have a collection        of artifacts from the group that toppled an Empire. Their importance to        history cannot be forgotten.",
"Why don't you come in? You can browse the displays, and we can talk. I       have a job you look perfect for.",
"Sounds good.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Let's talk inside.",
"Not interested.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Your loss, but if you change your mind, I'll be here.",
"Silus: Feel free to look around. Come talk to me when you're ready to discus       that job I mentioned.",
"Silus: The tapestries hung here and outside were found in hideouts where       members of the Mythic Dawn would meet and plot. The cult's greatest       accomplishment was the assassination of the Septim Dynasty and the       opening of the Oblivion Gates.",
"Silus: Those robes were worn during the Mythic Dawn's secret meetings, where       they plotted to bring the Daedra Mehrunes Dagon into Tamriel. Each bolt       of yarn used to make the robe was colored with a dye made from       sacrificial blood.",
"Silus: That burned paper is all that remains of the fabled Mysterium Xarxes.       The blasphemous book written by Mehrunes Dagon himself. It's said that       Mankar Camoran used the book to open a portal to a Paradise where all       his followers would live forever.",
"Silus: The commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes were written by the Mythic Dawn       cult leader, Mankar Camoran. He promised a paradise awaited his       followers when they died, that they would be reborn by Mehrunes Dagon's       side.",
"Silus: Ah, yes. That scabbard. Notice the insignia? An Oblivion Gate. A key       symbol of Mehrunes Dagon, the patron Daedra of the Mythic Dawn.",
"Silus: Did you have any questions about the museum, or would you rather talk       business?",
"Let's talk about this job you want done.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        A little history, first. After the Oblivion Crisis, a number of groups        cropped up dedicated to wiping out the remnants of the Mythic Dawn. One        of these groups found Mehrunes' Razor, the artifact of Dagon. They        split it into three fragments and pledged to keep them apart forever.        That was almost 150 years ago, and the pieces are still being kept by        the descendants of that group. And they're right here, in Skyrim.",
"You want me to get those fragments?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         At least two of the owners, Ghunzul and Drascua, are dangerous         marauders. And the third owner, Jorgen, I only know he lives in         Morthal. Here are my notes about them. I'll gladly pay you for         getting the pieces any way you can. No questions asked.",
"Stop right there. I'm not interested.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Fine. I can't force you to help me, but the offer is open.",
"Why did you open this museum?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        It's no secret that my family were once members of the Mythic Dawn.        One of my forefathers was even chosen to assassinate Uriel Septim        himself. We hid from our past for years, became tradesmen, people of        coin and influence. But I realized that the Mythic Dawn's importance        -- our importance -- to history cannot be denied. I'll see everyone in        Tamriel remember that for a moment, we held the fate of the world in        our hands, for good or ill.",
"So what is this Mythic Dawn cult?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        They were worshippers of Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Lord of        Destruction and Change. The Mythic Dawn killed Uriel Septim VII and        his heirs, triggering the events that lead to the Oblivion Crisis,        when the Daedra invaded Tamriel. All that remains of the infamous cult,        I've gathered in my museum.",
"Who is Mehrunes Dagon?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Ah, an excellent question. Mehrunes Dagon is the Daedric Lord of        Change, Destruction, and Ambition. Dagon's Mythic Dawn cult killed the        Septim Dynasty and opened the Oblivion Gates into Tamriel. They called        it the Oblivion Crisis.",
"Good luck finding the fragments.",
"Dragonborn: I'm looking for pieces of Mehrunes' Razor.",
"Jorgen: Don't know what you're talking about, stranger.",
"Dragonborn: Really? Silus Vesuius says otherwise.",
"Jorgen: I've heard of him. My father had suspicions about his connection to        the Mythic Dawn. Guess they were true. I don't need this. My family        wasted 8 generation keeping that Razor safe from a dead cult. As far        as I care, it can stay locked in my house.",
"You won't miss it, then. (Persuade)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         You want the hilt that bad? Fine. Here's the keys. It's locked in a         chest inside my house.",
"Give me the hilt, or things get ugly. (Intimidate)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Easy. Here. These are the keys. The hilt is in a chest in my house,         just don't hurt anyone.",
"Never mind, then.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Best leave the past buried, I say.",
"Silus: What is it? Do you have one of the Razor fragments?",
"The hilt of Mehrunes' Razor, as promised.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Did you try the grip? Isn't it eerie how it seems to mold itself into        your hand? Here's your gold.",
"Here's the pommel stone of Mehrunes' Razor.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Our master craftsman are nothing compared to the perfection of the        Daedra. Look how it shines. Here's your gold, as promised.",
"Silus: Finally, all the pieces of Mehrunes' Razor are in my hands. It's time I",
"You think Dagon will repair the Razor?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Ever since I was a boy, I felt this strange sense of destiny        surrounding the Mythic Dawn cult, and now I know what it is. Don't you        see? Fate has led you to me and to the pieces. Dagon has to answer our        call. We're so close. I'll meet you at the shrine.",
"This sounds like a terrible idea...       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        You don't want to be part of history? Fine. I'll be at the shrine if        you change your mind.",
"Silus: Good. You're here. I'll place the pieces on the altar, and Dagon should       speak to us. Mehrunes Dagon, the Lord of Change, we have brought your       Razor to you. We beg you, please bring the blade's full glory to Tamriel       again! It's not working. Why don't you give it a try? Just put your       hands on the altar.",
"Mehrunes Dagon: You. Mortal. You are worthy of speaking to. You have claimed                the pieces of my Razor. It has been an amusing game to witness.                But Dagon does not declare a winner while there is a pawn on                the board. Kill Silus. He and his family have served their                purpose.",
"It will be done, Lord Dagon.                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                 Kill him. Take your rightful place as my champion, or I will                 crush you.",
"He helped me find the pieces. He deserves to live.                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                 Only Dagon can declare if a pawn is worth keeping. I. Have.                 Spoken. Kill him. Take your rightful place as my champion, or                 I will crush you.",
"Silus: Wait. Wait. Don't kill me. There's another way. I can take the pieces       back to my museum. Seal them in a display case. You get a generous       amount of gold, I get to complete my collection, and nobody has to die.",
"Dagon has spoken.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Fine. I'm not dying without a fight!",
"Fine. Get out of here.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Thank you. Here's your gold. I'll make a run for it back to Dawnstar.",
"Mehrunes Dagon: I am pleased, mortal. I will give you my Razor. Use it to                wreak havoc on Tamriel!",
"Thank you, Lord Dagon.                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                 You have been a worthy tool. Fill the world with destruction                 in my name.",
"Place your hands on my altar one last time, and you will                witness the power of Mehrunes Dagon for yourself.",
"Mehrunes Dagon: Before you go, mortal. One final challenge. Ha ha ha.",
"Mehrunes Dagon: You think to betray Mehrunes Dagon? Suffer!",
"Thongvor Silver-Blood: What are you hiding, priest?",
"Verulus: I'm not hiding anything. It's closed for a reason.",
"Thongvor: Typical Imperial lies. First you take away Talos, now you're keeping          us from seeing our honored dead? You and the Jarl will answer for any          desecration of my ancestors' bodies.",
"Verulus: That's enough, Thongvor. We're done.",
"Verulus: If it's about the Hall of the Dead, no, you can't go in there.",
"Why not?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I can't talk about it. Rest assured, the Jarl hears everyone's          concerns. You will be able to visit the dead again soon.",
"Would some coin help? (### gold)          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           • Well, the Priesthood of Arkay always accepts generous donations.           • That's not going to work.",
"What's the Hall of the Dead?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          New to Skyrim? I was confused, too, at first. The Nords call their          mausoleums the Hall of the Dead. It's where people in the city are          buried. Fathers. Forefathers. Mothers. Foremothers.",
"Who's Arkay?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Arkay. One of the Eight Divines. God of the Cycle of Birth and Death.          It is his shrine people pray to when they visit the Hall. That his          divinity will watch over their ancestors on the way to the next life.",
"Verulus: We've discovered that some of the dead have been...eaten. Flesh has         been chewed off, bones were snapped to get at the marrow inside. We         haven't caught anyone or anything yet. It's like it knows when I'm         there. If you can get to the bottom of this, the Priesthood of Arkay         will reward you. Take my key and be careful... Tread lightly in the         Hall. We don't know what's in there.",
"Eola: You were young when you first tasted human flesh, weren't you? A brother      or sister had died? An accident, of course. Then the hunger set in.      Curiosity. What's the harm in just one bite? It's okay, now. You've found      a friend who understands you. You can let go of your guilt.",
"Guilt? What are you talking about?      I'm not a cannibal. What are you trying to do to me?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       A lot of our kind block out the memory of their first meal. The shame       is too much. But you don't need to hide anymore. Namira, the Lady of       Decay, accepts you for what you are. She has a place for us, where we       can sate our appetite without judgment.",
"Where is this place?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        It's inside Reachcliff Cave. But the dead have stirred from their        slumber recently, and I was forced here. Meet me there. We will fight        our way to Namira's embrace together. Until then, tell the people of        Markarth that their dead won't be disturbed, anymore. We have bigger        plans ahead.",
"Your tricks won't help you, monster!      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       To Oblivion with you then!",
"Verulus: You've returned. What happened in the Hall of the Dead?",
"Your cannibal has been taken care of.²         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I don't need to know the details. Blessings of Arkay to you for your          help.",
"The Hall of the Dead is now safe.         The Hall of the Dead is safe now.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Divines preserve you, you're a hero. We'll re-open the Hall right          Away.",
"Here. Take my amulet as a reward. Arkay protect you.",
"Eola: You've come. The draugr infesting Namira's sanctuary are inside.",
"Wait here. I'll take care of them.      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Then I'll wait.",
"Eola: Draugr are below. Foul¹ tasting. The shrine of Namira is further inside.      Keep going.",
"Eola: You've done it. The shrine is ours again. Now we need to prepare a grand      feast to welcome you to Namira's coven. You will have the honor of      bringing a fresh kill for the main course. And I know the perfect person.",
"Who is it?      Just tell me who needs to die.      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       A priest, filled with the taste of an easy life. Brother Verulus, from       Markarth. Give him this gold. Tell him you need Arkay's help exploring       an old cavern for treasure. And when he stands in Namira's presence,       she will take care of the rest.",
"Say hello to Verulus for me.",
"Dragonborn: I have need of a priest in my travels.",
"Verulus: You are looking for Arkay's protection while you delve some dank         tomb, I take it? My duties keep me busy in Markarth. I don't know if         I can help you.",
"There would be treasure to share... (Persuade)         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          • Treasure, you say? I suppose the Jarl won't mind if I'm gone for a            little while. Lead on.",
"You're coming with me. Now. (Intimidate)         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          • I think you need to calm down before I summon the guards.",
"Never mind, then.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Arkay watch over you.",
"Verulus: Who... who are you? What's going on?",
"Eola: Priest of Arkay. I'm your friend.",
"Verulus: You're my... friend....",
"Eola: Yes. I'm your friend, and I've invited you to dinner.",
"Verulus: I've been invited to dinner.... I'm so hungry....",
"Eola: Why don't you lay down and rest, while we get the meal ready?",
"Verulus: I need to lay down. I'll just be a minute....",
"Eola: Come with me. Our feast is about to begin.",
"Lisbet: I'm so glad Eola invited you to dinner.Dragonborn: Wait. I know you.Lisbet: One of my customers? Did you know I inherited the store from my late        husband? Shame what happened to him. He had such good taste.",
"Banning: I remember my first feast. I envy you.Dragonborn: Wait. I know you.Banning: Ah, yes. The courier. I guess you know my secret ingredient for that         spiced beef, now.",
"Hogni Red-Arm: Now this is going to be a good feast.Dragonborn: Wait. I know you.Hogni Red-Arm: 'The bloodiest beef in the Reach!' Ha ha ha.",
"Nimphaneth: You've brought us quite the meal.",
"Sanyon: Ah, the new disciple. I hear you have quite the appetite.",
"Eola: The meal is on Namira's table. Go ahead. Carve.",
"Eola: He looks so...sweet. Go ahead. Have the first bite.",
"System: Brother Verulus's still warm¹ body lies before you.",
"Namira: Mortal. I am Namira, the Lady of Decay. Your consumption of the blood        and bile of Arkay's own is pleasing to me. I give you my ring. Wear it,        and when you feast on the flesh of the death, I will grant you my        power.",
"Thank you, my Lady.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Wallow in your wretchedness, my newest champion.",
"That's a lot of work for such a little thing...        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Your mockery will be the end of you. And on that day, another servant         will feast on your entrails and discover a ring clenched in her         teeth. Be grateful for what time I give you until then.",
"Eola: I knew when you walked into the Hall of the Dead that you were special.      And here you are. Champion of Namira. Keeper of her ring. You're      everything I hoped you would be.",
"Thank you, Eola. For everything.      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       It's an honor, Champion. Feel free to stay and mingle with your new       coven.",
"You started the coven of Namira?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       No. This coven has existed for thousands of years. Namira is a goddess.       She has been worshipped since time began. I'm honored to be leading the       latest generation of Namira's faithful. Those who have embraced what       they are.",
"Irgnir: It's a curse! It has to be! I've got to get out of this town.",
"Fruki: Irgnir, get a hold of yourself. They're just dreams. Please tell her,       Erandur.",
"Erandur: Listen to your friend, Fruki. They are just dreams, my dear. I assure         you that it is quite normal.",
"Irgnir: It's the same dream over and over. You think that's normal? It's evil        I tell you!",
"Fruki: Erandur, she has a point. You keep telling us no harm will follow these       dreams, but they must be an omen.",
"Thoring: Give him a chance to speak. He's trying to help us.",
"Erandur: Everyone, please. I'm doing what I can to end these nightmares. In the         meantime all I ask is you remain strong and put your trust in Lady         Mara.",
"Irgnir: I...I will. Thank you...",
"Erandur: What troubles you, my son?",
"Dragonborn: What's wrong with everyone around here?",
"Erandur: The entire town is being plagued by horrible nightmares. They're in         serious danger but I'm afraid there's little I can do about it.",
"What could you do, anyway? Dreams aren't real.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          These dreams are manifestations created by the Daedric Lord Vaermina.          She has an awful hunger for our memories. In return, she leaves          behind nightmares not unlike a cough marks a serious illness. I must          end her terrible influence over these people before the damage          becomes permanent.",
"Don't be ridiculous. Dreams are harmless.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          In any other circumstance, I'd agree with you. However, these aren't          normal dreams. The Daedric Lord Vaermina's voracious hunger for          memories is responsible for these visions. The nightmares are an          echo of her presence as she feeds.",
"Then leave. This isn't your problem.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Turn my back on these people when their lives could be at stake? I          should say not. Those dreams are not just visions, they're a          footprint left by the Daedric Lord Vaermina as she drains these          people of their memories!",
"Dragonborn: What's your plan?",
"Erandur: I need to return to the source of the problem, to Nightcaller Temple.         Perhaps you'd be willing to assist me in that regard?",
"Dragonborn: What do you mean, 'return'? You've been there?",
"Erandur: I've already said too much. If anyone overhears what we're saying, it         could start a panic. I would simply ask that you trust me and help me         end Dawnstar's problems.",
"Sorry, I can't.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I understand. If you should change your mind, I'll be here.",
"Who is the Daedric Lord Vaermina?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Vaermina resides in a strange realm known as Quagmire...a nightmarish          land where reality shifts upon itself in seemingly impossible ways.          From her citadel at the center, she reaches forth to collect our          memories, leaving nothing in return apart from visions of horror and          despair.",
"What does she do with the memories?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Who can say? Perhaps she collects them for display like works of           art in a nonsensical art gallery. Whatever the case may be, her           intentions are far from benevolent.",
"Erandur: Follow me, it's this way. It feels good to finally have a chance to         help these people. Helplessly watching them suffer's been difficult.         The tower on that hill is our destination. People around here call it         the Tower of the Dawn. I'm not familiar with the tower's history, but         it was deserted for quite a long time before Nightcaller Temple was         established inside. When the temple was active the priests would         rarely be seen in Dawnstar. They preferred to live a solitary         existence. The temple's been abandoned for decades now. Ironic isn't         it...a ruin within a ruin? There's a small shrine to Mara I         established inside the tower's entry hall. I was hoping to seek         spiritual guidance from Her.",
"Erandur: Before we enter, I must warn you about the dangers that could be         lurking within. Years ago, this temple was raided by an orc war party         seeking revenge...they were being plagued by nightmares just like the         people of Dawnstar.",
"Dragonborn: Were they successful?",
"Erandur: No. Knowing they could never defeat the orcs, the priests of Vaermina         released what they call 'The Miasma,' putting everyone to sleep.",
"Dragonborn: Why is it dangerous if they're asleep?",
"Erandur: I'm concerned that when this place is unsealed, the Miasma will         dissipate and they'll awaken; both orcs and priests alike.",
"Dragonborn: What does the Miasma do?",
"Erandur: The Miasma was created by the priests of Vaermina for their rituals.         It's a gas that places the affected in a deep sleep. Because the         rituals would last for months or even years, the Miasma was designed         to slow down the aging process.",
"Dragonborn: Is the gas dangerous?",
"Erandur: Sadly, yes. The longer an individual is exposed to the Miasma, the         more the mind can become damaged. Those who've been under the effect         of it for extended periods of time have been known to lose their         minds entirely. In some cases, a few never awoke at all. Once we get         inside, all will become clear.",
"Erandur: Give me just a moment, and I'll have this open.",
"Erandur: Now I can show you the source of the nightmares. Over here.",
"Erandur: Behold the Skull of Corruption, the source of Dawnstar's woes. We         must reach the inner sanctum and destroy it. Come, there's no time         to lose.",
"Erandur: Damn it. The priests must have activated this barrier when the Miasma         was released.",
"Dragonborn: Looks difficult to breach.",
"Erandur: Impossible actually. Hmm, I wonder... There may be a way to bypass the         barrier, but I must check their library and confirm it can be done.",
"Dragonborn: You seem to know an awful lot about this place.",
"Erandur: I suppose there's no point in concealing the truth any longer. My         knowledge of this temple comes from personal experience. I was a         priest of Vaermina.",
"Why keep it a secret?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          When the orcs invaded the temple, I fled. I left my brothers and          sisters here to die.",
"You should have told me the truth.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Yes, you're right. I should have, but I didn't know what to say.          When the orcs raided the temple, I fled. I left my brothers and          sisters behind to die.",
"Dragonborn: All right. I'm ready.",
"Erandur: I still have my key to the library. Whenever you're ready, let's move         on.",
"How can the Skull be affecting Dawnstar?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Lore holds that the Skull of Corruption holds a constant hunger for          the memories of others. The Skull has been out of touch for so long,          I fear it's gained the ability to reach out on its own and try to          feed. What it does with these memories is just conjecture and an          argument for scholars and historians to this very day.",
"We mustn't tarry...the Skull needs to be destroyed as soon as         possible.",
"Erandur: It's just up here. Be careful...we're certain to find more of the         awakened within.",
"Erandur: This library used to be filled with arcane volumes. Now look at it;         almost everything's been burned. I hope the tome we need is still         intact.",
"Erandur: Barring any more interruptions, perhaps we can locate the information         I need.",
"Dragonborn: What am I looking for?",
"Erandur: We're looking for a book of alchemical recipes called 'The         Dreamstride.' The tome bears the likeness of Vaermina on the cover.         It should be here somewhere.",
"Dragonborn: Found it.",
"Erandur: Let me take a look... Mara be praised! There is a way past the barrier         to the inner sanctum. It involves a recipe for a liquid known as         Vaermina's Torpor.",
"Dragonborn: Is that some kind of potion?",
"Erandur: Yes. The Torpor grants an ability the priests of Vaermina called 'The         'Dreamstride'; using dreams to travel distances in the real world.",
"That's impossible.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I assure you, the Dreamstride is well known in Vaerminian Lore.",
"That's amazing!         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Quite amazing, yes. Alchemy and the blessings of a Divine distilled          down into an ingestible liquid.",
"Sadly, I have yet to see it function in person.",
"Dragonborn: I'm going to be the test subject, then?",
"Erandur: As a sworn priest of Mara, the elixir won't work for me. The Torpor         will only work for Priests or Vaermina, or the unaffiliated.",
"Sounds dangerous. How can you be sure?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I will not lie to you, there is some risk involved. The last time          the Torpor was imbibed could have been decades ago. But I swear upon          Lady Mara that I will do everything within my power to prevent any          harm from befalling you.",
"Forget it! It could kill me!         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          No, all my research points in the opposite direction. This is the          exact liquid the priests would drink. The only question in my mind          is whether you will be granted The Dreamstride. Otherwise, the worst          that could happen is a bad aftertaste. I swear upon Lady Mara that I          would never let any harm befall you.",
"Do you know where we can find the Torpor?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I believe there is a laboratory in the east wing. If we proceed          there, we should be able to locate a sample.",
"The laboratory adjoins the library. I'm hoping we'll find a sample of         the Torpor left undamaged.",
"Dragonborn: What will the Dreamstride feel like?",
"Erandur: You'll be viewing the memory of another through your own eyes and         with your own body. Those around you will perceive you as normal and         you will find the words you utter may not be your own. Thanks to all         of these odd principles, there is quite a lot of debate about whether         this is really a dream or just the machinations of Vaermina.",
"Dragonborn: How will I know when to awaken?",
"Erandur: I will watch over you as you slumber to ensure your safety. If I         deduce anything is amiss, I will use my arts to bring you back.         Otherwise, I am uncertain what will end your Dreamstride. Perhaps         when Vaermina's curious appetite has been filled.",
"Erandur: Now that they've been dealt with, we need to find the Torpor.",
"Dragonborn: How will I know what it looks like?",
"Erandur: It should be in a small bottle, very similar to a potion. I'll begin         searching up here. The Torpor should be in a tall bottle with a dark         liquid. If you find it, bring it to me.",
"Dragonborn: I found the Torpor.",
"Erandur: I'm relieved you found a bottle intact; this place looks as though         it were ransacked by the orcs. So...I've taken us this far, but you         need to guide us the rest of the way. Drink.",
"Dragonborn: Here? Now?",
"Erandur: Dawnstar's fate rests in that tiny bottle. The longer we wait, the         more damage Vaermina could be doing to those poor people. I understand         your hesitation, but I promise you that it works.",
"Thorek: The orcs have breached the inner sanctum, Brother Veren.",
"Veren Duleri: We must hold. We can't allow the Skull to fall into their hands.",
"Thorek: But...no more than a handful of us remain, brother.",
"Veren: Then we have no choice. The Miasma must be released.",
"Thorek: The Miasma? But, brother...",
"Veren: We have no alternative. It's the will of Vaermina. And what about you,       Brother Casimir? Are you prepared to serve the will of Vaermina?",
"Casimir: I've made my peace. I'm ready.",
"Veren: Then it's decided. Brother Casimir, you must activate the barrier and       release the Miasma. Let nothing stop you. Brother Thorek, we must remain       here and guard this Skull with our lives, if necessary.",
"Thorek: Agreed. To the death.",
"Veren: Then let it be done. Farewell, my brothers!",
"Erandur: It...it worked. Mara be praised! You vanished after drinking the         Torpor and materialized on the other side. I've never seen anything         quite like it.",
"It was remarkable... As if I were really there.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          How I envy you. I can only imagine the excitement of seeing history          through the eyes of another! Sadly, I am resigned to just reading of          its wonders through my research of the Skull.",
"It served a purpose.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          After what you just experienced, are you not amazed? I am at a loss          for words.",
"Are you mad? I could have died!         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I thought I was clear regarding the dangers that awaited you within          the Dreamstride. However, this hardly matters any longer as you          appear to have exited unscathed.",
"Dragonborn: We can discuss it later. We need to proceed.",
"Erandur: Indeed. My reverence for Vaermina's machinations should not take         precedence over our mission. My apologies. The inner sanctum lies         ahead. We must reach the Skull and put an end to Dawnstar's troubles.         Lead on, my friend.",
"Erandur: Veren...Thorek...you're alive!",
"Veren: No thanks to you, Casimir.",
"Erandur: I no longer use that name. I'm Erandur, Priest of Mara.",
"Veren: You're a traitor. You left us to die and ran before the Miasma took       you.",
"Erandur: No. I...I was scared. I wasn't ready to sleep.",
"Veren: Enough of your lies! I can't allow you to destroy the Skull, Priest of       Mara.",
"Erandur: Then you leave me no choice!",
"Veren: How could you, Erandur...",
"Erandur: I...knew Veren and Thorek. They were my friends. Is this punishment         for my past? Is it Mara's will to torment me so?",
"We had no choice.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Yes. You're right. If they needed to die so that Dawnstar could          live, then it was worth the price.",
"They were trying to kill us.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          And had they succeeded, Dawnstar's fate would have been sealed. You          have a unique way of looking at things, my friend.",
"Maybe they were right. Don't destroy the staff.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          No! You mustn't listen to them. They speak only lies and deception.          Had we aided them in releasing the Skull, they would use it to wreak          havoc across Skyrim. They...they had to die.",
"It's time. The Skull must be destroyed. If you'll stand back, I'll         perform the ritual granted to me by Lady Mara. First, an incantation         to remove the barrier... I call upon you Lady Mara! The Skull hungers.         It yearns for memories and leaves nightmares in its wake. Grant me         the power to break through this barrier and to send the Skull to the         depths of Oblivion!",
"Vaermina: He's deceiving you. When the ritual's complete, the Skull will be          free and then Erandur will turn on you. Quickly! Kill him now. Kill          him and claim the Skull for your own! Vaermina commands you!",
"Erandur: Forgive me if I don't appear relieved...this temple has taken its         toll on me.",
"Are you going to be all right?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          In time, I believe I will.",
"So we're done, then?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Yes. The Skull has been destroyed and Dawnstar is safe.",
"How about some compensation?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Being a humble servant of Mara, I have little in the way of gold or          coin, but perhaps I could offer you something better...companionship.",
"Dragonborn: Thank you.",
"Erandur: There's no need to thank me. What you did was for the people of         Dawnstar. If anyone should be thanked, it should be you.",
"Hulda: Been hearing some strange tales of the Jarl's children. Say the one's       turning wicked, and the others have an ill-favored look to them. Best       to keep clear.",
"Dragonborn: I heard there's trouble with your children.",
"Balgruuf: Yes, my youngest son. He's a dark child. I don't know what to do with          him. He was always a quiet lad, but lately...something has changed.          He's become brooding. Violent. He won't say a word to me, but I don't          know how I upset him. If you could speak with him. Draw out the          truth. I would be immensely grateful.",
"Dragonborn: Your father said to speak to you.",
"Nelkir: So the disgusting pig sent you to bother me? One day, I'll tear his        face apart so he can leave me alone. My father doesn't know anything        about me. But I know about him. And about the war. More than he might        think.",
"What sorts of things?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I know that he still worships Talos. That he hates the Thalmor almost         as much as the Stormcloaks do. That he worries about being chased from         Whiterun. That he...that I'm...that I don't have the same mother as my         brother and sister.         How do you know these things?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         This castle is old. Lots of places nobody's been in a long while.         Places where you can overhear things. See things. And the Whispering         Lady.",
"Dragonborn: Who's the Whispering Lady?",
"Nelkir: She won't tell me her name. I've gotten good at listening to keyholes.        At the door in the basement, I hear her talking to me. I thought I was        caught, but she started telling me even more secrets. But I can't open        the door.",
"Dragonborn: Where is this door?",
"Nelkir: In the basement. Trust me, you'll see it. I bet she'll talk to you,        too.",
"Dragonborn: (Listen at the door)",
"Is there someone behind the door?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Regrettably, I cannot reach your plane so directly. But I forgive          you for not knowing who I am. Few hear my whispers anymore. I am          Mephala, the Lady of Whispers. I tug at the web of connections          between mortals. Love, hatred, loyalty, betrayal. The boy was good          at sussing out secrets. You, I expect to take a more active role.",
"What could the boy not do?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          The boy is good at sussing out secrets, but the corruptibility of          children is ultimately too limited for my purposes. You, though, I          expect will prove far more malleable.",
"Who are you to expect anything?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I forgive your not knowing my name. Few can hear my whispers           anymore. I am Mephala, the Lady of Whispers. I tug at the web of           connections between mortals. Love, hatred, loyalty, betrayal.",
"What do you want me to do?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          First, you must open this door. A piece of my power has been locked          away behind it, and even my eyes cannot see past the seals. I'd much          rather it be in the hands of an ambitious and talented person such          as yourself.",
"Dragonborn: How do I open the door?",
"Mephala: The whole of Whiterun is ripe with paranoia and tensions. The Jarl's         court is right to fear the power I hold behind this door. The Jarl         trusts few, and they will be his undoing. The dark child knows of what         I speak. Let him guide your path.",
"Nelkir: You...you know the Whispering Lady, don't you. I can tell.",
"Dragonborn: Do you know how to open the Whispering Door?",
"Nelkir: I told you, I know everything about this castle. For some reason that        door is special. Only two people can open it, Balgruuf and Farengar,        the court wizard. How you get it from them is up to you. Nobody would        notice if Farengar went missing, I promise you.",
"Mephala: Excellent work. Now, I trust you're sharp enough to see that the sword         doesn't match the description of the Ebony Blade you may know. It has         languished too long outside the winds of alliance and betrayal. To         return to its past glory, it must first drink the blood of deceit.         Your world is admirably seeped in lies and inclinations. My blade is         a darling leech that feeds on deceptions, and nourishes its master.         Seek out those closest to you. The final pluck of their misguided         heartstrings will accompany my blade in a song of your grandeur.",
"Aventus: Sweet mother, sweet mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of         the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear.",
"Aventus: You've come at last! I knew you would!",
"Dragonborn: Are you all right?",
"Aventus: It worked! I knew you'd come, I just knew it! I did the Black         Sacrament, over and over! With the body, and the...things. And then         you came! An assassin from the Dark Brotherhood!",
"Yes, of course... The Black Sacrament...         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          It took so long. So very long. But now that you're here, you can          accept my contract.",
"Dragonborn: Contract?",
"Aventus: My mother, she...she died. I...I'm all alone now. So they sent me to         that terrible orphanage in Riften. Honorhall. The headmistress is an         evil, cruel woman. They call her Grelod the Kind. But he's not kind.         She's terrible. To all of us. So I ran away, and came home. And         performed the Black Sacrament. Now you're here! And you can kill         Grelod the Kind!",
"Dragonborn: Grelod? As it turns out...I already killed her.",
"Aventus: You did? Really? This is the best news I've ever gotten! I mean, I         knew the Dark Brotherhood was good...just not that good! You killed         the old hag before I even asked! Oh, and please, take this as payment.         It's an old family heirloom, supposed to be pretty valuable. It should         fetch you a nice price. Thank you again!",
"Aventus: Grelod is the headmistress of Honorhall Orphanage. But not for long.",
"Assassinations don't come cheap, boy.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I have a family heirloom you can have. Supposed to be sort of          valuable. I hope that's all right.",
"Tell me about your mother. What happened?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          She got sick, last winter, when the snows came. And she just...she          never got better. Not all year. One night she just fell asleep and...          never woke up. So now I'm all alone. And the Jarl said I had to go          to Honorhall Orphanage. It's not fair!",
"Are you sure about this, boy? Murdering this woman?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I've never been more sure about anything in my entire life. Someone          like Grelod doesn't deserve to live one more day. She's a monster.",
"Grelod: Those who shirk their duties will get an extra beating. Do I make        myself clear?",
"Kids: Yes, Grelod.",
"Grelod: And one more thing! I will hear no more talk of adoptions! None of you        riff-raff is getting adopted. Ever! Nobody needs you, nobody wants you.        That, my darlings, is why you're here. Why you will always be here,        until the day you come of age and get thrown into that wide, horrible        world. Now, what do you all say?",
"Kids: We love you, Grelod. Thank you for your kindness.",
"Grelod: That's better. Now scurry off, my little guttersnipes.",
"Grelod: What do you want? You have no business being here.",
"The Dark Brotherhood has come, Grelod.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         The what? Why how dare you! I will not be intimidated in my own         orphanage! Get out! Get out this instant!",
"Aventus Aretino says hello.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Aretino? Why that little bastard! You tell him I'm coming for him!         And when I find him, it will be the beating of his miserable life!",
"Hroar: Someone has killed Grelod! Ha ha ha ha ha!",
"Runa: Grelod is dead! Aventus did it! Ha ha ha ha ha!",
"Samuel: Hooray! Grelod the Kind is dead at last! We're saved!",
"Francois: Yay!",

"Dragonborn: Grelod the Kind is dead.",
"Aventus: Aha! I knew you could do it! I just knew it! I knew the Dark         Brotherhood would save me! Here, just like I promised! This should         fetch you a nice price. And thank you. Thank you again.",
"Aventus: I'll go back to the Orphanage in a while. I'll give them time to,         you know...clean up the mess.",
"Aventus: When I grow up, I'm going to be an assassin. That way I can help lots         of children, just like you!",
"Astrid: Sleep well?",
"Dragonborn: What? Where am I? Who are you?",
"Astrid: Does it matter? You're warm, dry...and still very much alive. That's        more than can be said for old Grelod. Hmm?",
"Dragonborn: You know about that?",
"Astrid: Half of Skyrim knows. Old hag gets butchered in her own orphanage?        Things like that tend to get around. Oh, but don't misunderstand. I'm        not criticizing. It was a good kill. Old crone had it coming. And you        saved a group of urchins, to boot. Ah, but there is a slight...problem.",
"Dragonborn: You want me to murder someone else? Who?",
"Astrid: Well now. Funny you should ask. If you turn around, you'll notice my        guests. I've 'collected' them from...well, that's not really important.        The here and now. That's what matters. You see, there's a contract out        on one of them, and that person can't leave this room alive. But...        which one? Go on, see if you can figure it out. Make your choice. Make",
"All right, I'll do it. I'll kill one of them.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         See, I knew we could resolve this civilly. A debt owed must be repaid.         You understand that. Well, get to it then. Pick your guest, and send         the poor fool to the Void. I'll give you the key to this shack, and         you'll be on your way.",
"Astrid: I'll cut right to it. You murdered the old woman in the Orphanage.        You owe the Dark Brotherhood a kill. I've come to collect. One of        these poor sods has a contract out on their life. Which one is it? Any        idea? Make your choice. Make your kill. And you get to walk away.",
"Vasha: Whoever this is, clearly we got off on the wrong foot. Ah, but no       worries. This is not the first time I have been bagged and dragged.       Come now. Whatever the problem, we can talk about it like civilized       folk, hmm?",
"Who are you?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Ahhh...Vasha, at your service. Obtainer of goods, taker of lives, and        defiler of daughters. Have you not heard of me? Perhaps I will have my        people carve my name into your corpse, as a reminder.",
"Would someone pay to have you killed?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Me? Ha! Are you serious?",
"Answer me, or I'll paint this room with your blood! (Intimidate)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Fool! Don't you get it? I live in the shadow of death every day. A         knife in the doorway, a nocked arrow on every rooftop! If one of my         enemies wouldn't pay to have me killed, I would take it as a personal         insult.",
"Come on, you can tell me. We're all friends here. (Persuade)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         He he he he he he. The real question is, 'Would someone pay to have         me killed...again.' A day goes by without someone trying to gut me         in the street, I get disappointed.",
"Tell you what. You release me, and I promise my associates won't hunt       you down like an animal and butcher you in the street. It is a win-win.",
"Alea: Get these things off me! Cowards! Stealing a woman from her home! For      shame!",
"Who are you?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       None of your damned business who I am! If you're going to kill me, just       do it already! As Mara as my witness, if I didn't have this hood on       right now I would spit right in your face...",
"Would someone pay to have you killed?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Excuse me? What kind of question is that?",
"One last time: Would. Someone. Pay. To. Have. You. Killed? (Intimidate)       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        I'm kneeling here with my hands bound and a sack over my head, and you        have the gall to ask me that? What do you think, genius?",
"It's all right. Just tell me what I need to know.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        I'm a woman living in Skyrim with six children and no husband. I don't        have the time or the patience to be 'nice'. Do some people look down on        me? Have I made some enemies? You're damn right.",
"Fultheim: I...I can hear you talking out there. Please, let me go. I've done          nothing to you. Is this about that raid last week? I told Holgrim          there was no honor in killing sleeping men, but he wouldn't listen!          It wasn't my fault, I swear!",
"Who are you?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           My name is Fultheim. I'm a soldier. Well, mercenary, really. You           know, a...a sellsword. I've lived in Skyrim all my life. That's all!           I'm a nobody, really. So can't you just let me go?",
"Would someone pay to have you killed?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           What? Oh gods, I don't want to die...",
"Answer me, or die! (Intimidate)           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Please! I don't know! I mean, I'm a soldier. I've killed people.            When I was ordered to. Maybe there were some times...some times I            got carried away? But war is war. Right? Nobody could blame me for            that. Could they?",
"Shhh... Don't be afraid. You can tell me. (Persuade)           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Okay, well...I guess it's possible. I've been selling my sword arm            for years now. Killed a lot of people. Could be someone wanted            revenge. But... But you're not going to kill me. Right?",
"What did I do? Please, whatever it is, I'm sorry.",
"Astrid: • Oh ho. The whimpering Nord, eh? Yes, yes, I can see how you'd come to          that conclusion. Interesting choice.",
"So who was it? Who had the contract?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Oh. No, no, no. Don't you understand? Guilt, innocence, right,         wrong... Irrelevant. What matters is I ordered you to kill someone,         and you obeyed.",
"You told me to kill, and I killed.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Indeed. For you, my friend, seem to understand what's truly important.         When I give an order to spill blood, you follow it. No questions. No         remorse.",
"Dragonborn: So...I'm free to go?",
"Astrid: Of course. And you've repaid your debt, in full. Here's the key to the        shack. But why stop here? I say we take our relationship to the next        level. I would like to officially extend to you an invitation to join        my Family. The Dark Brotherhood. In the southwest region of Skyrim, in        the Pine Forest, you'll find the entrance to our Sanctuary. It's just        beneath the road, hidden from view. When questioned by the Black Door,        answer with the correct passphrase: 'Silence, my brother.' Then you're        in. And your new life begins. I'll see you at home.",
"Astrid: Well done...",
"Astrid: Ah, at last. I hope you found the place all right.",
"Dragonborn: So what happens now?",
"Astrid: Well, what happens now is you start your new life in the Dark        Brotherhood. You're part of the Family, after all. This, as you can        see, is our Sanctuary. You won't find a safer place in all of Skyrim.        So get comfortable.",
"When do I get to kill someone?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Soon, my dearest. Soon. I'm arranging a job for you, but I need some         more time. For now, go talk to Nazir. He may have some smaller         contracts to tide you over.",
"Soon, the Night Mother will arrive. And things around here are sure to        get even more interesting. Ah, but one last thing. A welcome home        present. The armor of the Dark Brotherhood. May it serve you well in        all your...endeavors.",
"Who is the Night Mother?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         The Unholy Matron, the Shrouded Lady, the Mistress of the Void. She         goes by many names. Ages past, Sithis gave a woman five children. She         killed them to win his favor, thus becoming the Night Mother. If you         believe that sort of thing. Today, she's...well, she's a skeleton. An         ancient corpse. But, more importantly, a corpse that's being brought         to this Sanctuary by her Keeper.",
"So the Night Mother is being brought here?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Yes. A few months ago I received word from the Night Mother's Keeper          that he had arrived in Skyrim from Cyrodiil. The Night Mother's          crypt, in Bravil, was destroyed. A result of the chaos caused by          the war with the Thalmor. That forced a relocation. I don't know          where the Keeper has been these past few months, but I recently          received another letter. He's bringing the Night Mother here. Soon.",
"What if I get caught killing someone?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Try not to? But I do realize sometimes it's not that easy. You may         want to make a statement, or a contract may require a public killing.         Murder is, obviously, a very serious crime, and a very high bounty         will be put on your head in the hold where the act was committed. You         can run, obviously, but you'll still have a price on your head. If a         guard attacks, you can attempt to yield by sheathing your weapon. If         the guard accepts, you can serve your time in a cell, or pay off your         bounty. We've all gone through it. We do what we must to survive. But,         there is another option. Some members of the Thieves Guild in Riften         can get their bounties...erased. For a price. Something to think         about.",
"Where do the contracts come from?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         They used to come from the Night Mother. Potential clients would         perform the Black Sacrament, and she would hear their prayers. The         Night Mother would communicate this to the Listener, who would then         dispatch a Speaker to arrange the contract with the client. But that         was a long time ago. There hasn't been a Listener in years, not since         Cyrodiil was overrun in the war with the Thalmor. But people don't         know that. So they still perform the ritual...and we eventually hear         about it. When someone wants us, we find out.",
"Are there any rules I should be aware of?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Used to be the Dark Brotherhood was bound by Five Tenets, but we         stopped following those years ago. All those rules, all that         discipline, and look where the Dark Brotherhood ended up. We're the         last of our kind, and we live the way we see fit. Bottom line --         respect your Family. Do that, and everything else will fall into         place.",
"What can you tell me about yourself?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         This Sanctuary has been my entire life since I was a young woman.         That's when I discovered my, shall we call it 'aptitude,' for         elimination. I had an uncle, you see. He made certain...unwanted         advances. So I killed him. And liked it. Then, I killed again. And         liked it even more. And so on. I was recruited by the Dark Brotherhood         and have been here ever since. I met my husband Arnbjorn, rose to         leadership. And now here we are.",
"Be sure and introduce yourself to your new Family members. They're all        very eager to meet you.",
"Veezara: Ha ha ha ha! Again! Again! Do the part where he tries to buy you some         candy!",
"Babette: Okay, okay. Wait. Here we go. 'Ooh, you're such a pretty little girl.         Would the sweetie like a sweetie? Oh yes, how about some chocolate?'         Oh yes, please kind sir! My mama and papa left me all alone, and I'm         so very hungry. I know a shortcut to the candy shop. Through this         alley. 'Oh ya, very good. Very good. My it is dark down here. Oh, but         you are so beautiful. Such a lovely smile. Your teeth...your teeth!         No! Aggghh!!'",
"Arnbjorn: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!",
"Gabriella: Oh Babette, but you are so wicked.",
"Nazir: What about you, Festus? How did that last contract turn out?",
"Arnbjorn: Ah, yes, please, old man. Regale us with your tales of wizardry...",
"Festus Krex: Ah, the young and stupid. Always mocking the experienced and             brilliant. My contract went very well, I'll have you know. Tried             a new spell. Little something I've been working on in my spare             time. Came 'this' close to turning that priest inside-out. Damned             messy.",
"Gabriella: And what of your latest, Arnbjorn? Something about a Khajiit?           Merchant was it?",
"Babette: Oh, a big doggy chasing a little kitty! How adorable!",
"Festus: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!",
"Nazir: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!",
"Veezara: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!",
"Arnbjorn: I am not adorable, it was not funny, and he wasn't a merchant. He          was a Khajiit monk, a master of the Whispering Fang style. But now          he's dead...and I have a new loincloth.",
"Festus: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!",
"Nazir: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!",
"Babette: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!",
"Arnbjorn: Well, well. It's raw meat. Oh, my beautiful wife has told me all          about you. Let me guess -- Astrid failed to mention I'm her husband?          She has a tendency to do that. Doesn't want the others thinking she          plays favorites.",
"What can you tell me about yourself?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           • Look. If you're trying to get to know me -- don't. I don't like             you, and I never will. It's nothing personal. But... My wife             trusts you, and I trust her judgment. So you can't be all bad.             Here's what you need to know: I'm a werewolf. I like killing             things. I love Astrid. I hate annoying people. And the color blue             gives me a headache.",
"Babette: There you are! Astrid's told me all about you. Heard she pulled the         ole 'Choose your victim' gag with you. Ah, I love that one... Don't         let my appearance throw you off. I'm older than you. A lot older.         Getting bitten by a vampire when you're ten will do that to a girl.",
"What can you tell me about yourself?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I'm just a little girl! The Dark Brotherhood killed my mama and papa,          and then they took me captive! Please, please help me! Rather          convincing, don't you think? In truth, I'm no more a little girl than          you are. I was once, of course. Three hundred years ago. Vampirism          tends to keep one remarkably...fresh.",
"Can't wait to hear all about the next person you murder.",
"Festus: Yes, yes, you're the new Family member. Let's make this easy --        consider me the cranky old uncle nobody talks to. You go your way,        I'll go on mine. There's too much of an obsession these days with        knives and arrows. You can kill someone just as easily with a well-        -placed spell.",
"What can you tell me about yourself?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Hmph. I like to say I was born with a wand in my hand. Well, not         literally -- you can see how painful that would have been for mother.         But I was a prodigy! Casting simple spells by one, completing complex         incantations by three. Resurrecting corpses by seven! Ha. When I was         thirteen, I accidentally burned down the family home. A bit of         lightning gone awry. Ah, but soon after I mastered my gifts.         Completely. I went on to teach at the College -- left after two years.         Too simple. Too safe. None of them truly understood the glory of the         Destruction school...",
"Remember, fireballs. You can never go wrong.",
"Gabriella: New brother. May I offer my most sincere welcome to our Family.           Does death not come to us all? Is it not a certainty? I am,           therefore, honored to be doom's herald. To play some part in a           being's inevitable end.",
"What can you tell me about yourself?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            What a curious question. Well, I enjoy moonlit nights, taking long            walks on the beach, knitting and unicorns. In fact, I once took a            seaside stroll, on a moonlit night, and discovered a unicorn...            which I proceeded to stab in the throat with a crochet needle. I'm            a woman of refined, yet simple tastes.",
"Until next time, brother.",
"Veezara: Welcome, my brother. Welcome to our Sanctuary. You have made the right         choice joining us, I assure you. Me, I have been part of the Dark         Brotherhood from the day I first hatched. I am Shadowscale, you see.         Born under the sign of the Shadow.",
"What can you tell me about yourself?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Once, I was a Shadowscale. An assassin in service to the King of          Black Marsh. Trained by the Dark Brotherhood since the day of my          hatching. Ah, but that was a lifetime ago. Today, I am the last of          my kind. My order is extinct. Now, I happily serve Astrid, and this          Sanctuary. I am a trained killer, and once again have been given          purpose. Life is good.",
"Stay safe.",
"Nazir: So, you're the newest member of our dwindling, dysfunctional little       Family. I've heard quite a bit about you.",
"It's a pleasure to meet you.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Save the niceties for now. I have no intention of getting invested in        someone who may be dead tomorrow. If you're still breathing in a few        weeks, I'm sure we'll be the best of friends.",
"You will hear more, I assure you.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Ooh, cocky. I give you three days before you screw up and someone        runs a knife across your throat. But who knows? I've been proven wrong        beofre.",
"Dragonborn: Astrid said you'd have some work for me.",
"Nazir: Did she, now? Well, as it turns out, there are a few lingering we       haven't had the chance to complete just yet. And more, dribbling in from       time to time. I'll assign them to you as they become available. To be       completed at your leisure.",
"Dragonborn: Sounds simple enough.",
"Nazir: It is. These aren't particularly glamorous assassinations, I'll be       honest. Don't pay much, either. But they'll keep you busy. Just do them       as you're able. There's no real time limit -- the targets aren't going       anywhere. You can turn each one in as it's completed, or wait and turn       in the whole group when all the targets have been eliminated. Whichever       works for you.",
"What can you tell me about yourself?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Ah, well, I'm a Redguard, as I'm sure you've noticed. Though not like        most of my kind in Skyrim, that's for damned sure. I am a child of        Hammerfell, born on the sands of the mighty Alik'r. In that great        desert, blood is a shade of crimson I can scarce describe. My past is        long and storied, and not altogether proud. The Dark Brotherhood saved        me from myself. And I have never looked back.",
"Dragonborn: I'm ready for the first set of contracts.",
"Nazir: Well then, let's get started. I've got three available right now. Your       targets are the beggar Narfi, an ex-miller named Ennodius Papius, and       Beitild, a mine boss. When you've completed all those, we'll see if I       might have some more.",
"Tell me about Narfi.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        He's a hapless beggar living in some ruins just outside the village of        Ivarstead. Easy even for you.",
"Tell me about Ennodius.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        He lives just outside Anga's Mill, in the woods. He was once the        miller. Now Papius is just a paranoid recluse who thinks someone is        out to get him. And he's right.",
"Tell me about Beitild.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        She separated from her husband several months ago. Now the two run        competing mining operations. Beitild's angry and desperate. A fighter.",
"Happy hunting.",
"Narfi: Who are you? What do you want?",
"Beg! Beg for your miserable life!       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        No! Oh, by the gods, please no!",
"Your pathetic existence has come to an end, Narfi.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Oh... Oh no... Please, please...I ain't never harmed no one... Old        Narfi just wants to be left alone...",
"Ennodius: Why are you here? Get away from me!",
"You were right to paranoid, Ennodius.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           What? What do you mean? Oh! Oh...no... No!",
"Die, worm!          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Aiiiiiiiieeeeeee!",
"Beitild: I'm really not in the mood. State your business, or take your leave.",
"Someone wants you dead, Beitild.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          And let me guess, that so-called someone is my husband Leigelf? Well          the feeling's mutual.",
"Dragonborn: Narfi is dead.",
"Nazir: Congratulations. You slaughtered an emaciated beggar in cold blood. You       are truly an opponent to be feared. Here's your payment.",
"Dragonborn: Ennodius is dead.",
"Nazir: Good. And I hope you were careful in that lumber mill. Those splinters       and rusty nails can be quite nasty. Your payment, for a job well done.",
"Dragonborn: Beitild is dead.",
"Nazir: Of course she is. I hear the mining business is extremely cutthroat.       And those hours...they're murder. I could do this all day. Here's your       payment.",
"Cicero: But the Night Mother is mother to all! It is her voice we follow! Her        will! Would you dare risk disobedience? And surely...punishment?",
"Arnbjorn: Keep talking, little man, and we'll see who gets 'punished'.",
"Festus: Oh be quiet, you great lumbering lapdog. The man has had a long        journey. You can at least be civil. Mister Cicero, I for one am        delighted you and the Night Mother have arrived. Your presence here        signals a welcome return to tradition.",
"Cicero: Oh, what a kind and wise wizard you are. Sure to earn our Lady's favor.",
"Astrid: You and the Night Mother are of course welcome here, Cicero. And you        will be afforded the respect deserving of your position as Keeper.        Understood...husband?",
"Arnbjorn: Hmph.",
"Cicero: Oh, yes yes yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you!",
"Astrid: But make no mistake. I am the leader of this Sanctuary. My word is law.        Are we clear on that point?",
"Cicero: Oh yes, mistress. Perfectly! You're the boss.",
"Astrid: Ah, there you are. Good, I was done speaking to that muttering fool        anyway. We've got some business to discuss.",
"Dragonborn: Do you have a contract for me?",
"Astrid: I do indeed. You must go to the city of Markarth, and speak with the        apothecary's assistant. You'll probably find her in the Hag's Cure,        when the shop is open. The girl's been running her mouth, wants an        ex-lover killed. She's apparently performed the Black Sacrament. Her        name is Muiri. I need you to talk to her, set up the contract, and        carry it out.",
"Dragonborn: Anything else?",
"Astrid: Just do whatever the contact wishes. Be professional, represent us        well, and get the job done. Since it's your first contract, I'll let        you keep whatever Muiri pays. She'll be generous, I'm sure. They        always are.",
"Astrid: Just be yourself. Eliminate the targets any way you see fit. Quiet,        loud, quick, slow -- whatever you feel is best. Occasionally I'll give        you a contract with certain parameters. Stay within them, and you'll        earn yourself a bonus.",
"Astrid: Very little. You have my word on that. The Night Mother represents a        chapter in the Dark Brotherhood's history that has long since been        closed. Today we live by our own rules. We're the last Sanctuary in        all of Tamriel, and only by forgoing the old ways have we survived        this long. My only worry is her 'Keeper.' I'm not sure what Cicero        expects to gain by bringing the Night Mother here, but he'll soon learn        this is my Sanctuary.",
"Arnbjorn: Yeah. Follow my wife's orders, and don't do anything stupid.",
"Arnbjorn: The witless fool and his pet corpse? Take a guess.",
"Babette: You're headed to the Hag's Cure, right? It's a good shop. You should         examine their wares. Never pass up the chance to buy a good potion...         or poison. And one more thing. Have fun. You'll be committing a dark         deed, but there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy yourself. You're only         young once. Trust me, I know.",
"Babette: Two hundred years ago, I would have lain down my life for the Unholy         Matron. But that age has long since passed. Astrid is my matron now.",
"Festus: Yes. Just because you're now a professional assasin, don't think you        have to skulk around in the shadows like a skeever and stab people.        Do what I do. Walk up to your target, introduce yourself, melt their        skin off, and then run like the wind. Works every time.",
"Festus: Their arrival is the best thing that's happened to this Sanctuary in        years. Astrid is an effective leader, but we've been rudderless for        too long. Scrounging for contracts, abandoning the Tenets. The Dark        Brotherhood has been reduced to a group of common cutthroats. Frankly,        it's embarrassing.",
"Gabriella: You're being sent to meet with the contact directly, is that           correct? What a most unusual occurrence. Astrid usually performs           this duty herself. I can only assume she wants to test the full           breadth of your abilities. So. Be polite, and professional, and           represent us well.",
"Gabriella: Without the Night Mother, there is no Dark Brotherhood. The Matron           deserves our unwavering support and respect. Though I admit, I find           her Keeper a bit too exuberant for my liking.",
"Veezera: You must speak to that Muiri woman, correct? I have heard rumors in         Windhelm. She was recently implicated in a thievery, along with her         lover. The lover will likely be your target. If memory serves me         correctly, he leads a group of bandits. So this may be rather         interesting for you.",
"Veezera: Truthfully? I'm not entirely sure. It's not that I don't have the         utmost respect for Sithis, and the Night Mother, and the ancient ways.         I do. But I've never been much for religion. I kill because it's what         I've been trained to do. It's all I know. So long as Astrid is happy,         I'm happy.",
"Nazir: The contracts I dole out are fairly simple -- go to a location, and kill       the target. But this is different. The jobs Astrid gives you will be       more important, and usually more complex. Just keep your wits about you.       And for Sithis' sake, don't get killed.",
"Nazir: I don't like mimes, minstrels, thespians, acrobats, jugglers,       troubadours or tumblers. Flutists give me a headache. I particularly       hate jesters. As a rule, I'm also not crazy about the corpses of old       women. For the Night Mother, I'll make an exception. But Astrid is the       only mistress I serve.",
"Cicero: Wait, oh wait. I know you! Yes, yes. From the road! Cicero never        forgets a face.",
"Dragonborn: You're the man with the wagon! Transporting his mother...",
"Cicero: I am! I am! But not just my mother. Our mother, hmm? The Night Mother!        Oh yes!",
"Cicero: Another member of the Family! Hello, hello. So very good to meet you.",
"It's good to meet you too, Cicero.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         So polite! So nice! Cicero likes you. The Night Mother is sure to like         you too. Oh, we're going to be fast friends. Fast friends.",
"Keep your distance, jester, and we'll get along just fine.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Do you mistrust poor Cicero? I am, as you say, just an innocent         jester. A fool! Oh, but my work is not foolish, no. For I am our         mother's Keeper.",
"Why did you come to the Sanctuary?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         The Night Mother's crypt in Bravil was...desecrated. The Imperial         Province is ravaged by strife. Nowhere there is safe, at present. So         Cicero brought our Lady to her new home. Here! This is the only         Sanctuary left in all of Skyrim, you see. Such was my...honor. As         Keeper.",
"Who is the Night Mother?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          What? Who is the Night Mother? Oh! Oh, you jest! You jest with          gullible Cicero! You of course know that the Night Mother is our          Unholy Matron. The undying spirit of a great woman who birthed the          children of Sithis. And killed them. In his honor.",
"Tell me about Sithis.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Hmmm... That's like telling you about the cold of space, or terror           of midnight. Sithis is all those things. He is...the Void.",
"What are the duties of a Keeper?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Oh, Cicero takes care of our Lady's body. Oils it, preserves it,          keeps it safe. Makes sure nobody disrespects our Matron's coffin.",
"What can you tell me about yourself?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Me? Oh, Cicero is just the Keeper! I...keep! I look after our matron,         you see. The Night Mother. I keep her clean, and protected, and         happy... But I am not the Listener. Oh no. There is no Listener. Not         yet! But some day, some day, some day I pray that one will come to         hear her say... The words.",
"The Listener? What's a Listener?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Oh, well, the Listener is the only person the Night Mother speaks to.          It is the highest honor attainable by a member of the Dark          Brotherhood. Of course our Lady is dead, so she doesn't talk with          words, since her lips are...rotted. But inside the Listener's head.          I hear it's...intimate. Ah, but there has not been a Listener in          years and years. Our Lady has not chosen Cicero, and certainly not          Astrid. Or...anyone. But some day...",
"Farewell, farewell!",
"Muiri: Why are you looking at me like that?",
"Dragonborn: The Dark Brotherhood has come, Muiri.",
"Muiri: The Dark Brotherh... Oh. Oh! I...my goodness, you're really here! The       Black Sacrament. It actually worked?",
"Dragonborn: Obviously. Now tell me what you need.",
"Muiri: What I need? What I need is for Alain Dufont to die! I want him hunted       down and murdered like the dog he is!",
"Actually, Alain Dufont is already dead. I killed him.²       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        What? Alain is...is dead? I...I'm grateful. It's just this...this isn't        at all how I imagined things would play out. There was Alain, but I        was considering more, and... Ah, well. Dead is dead. Right? My thanks        to you, assassin. Here's the gold I was going to pay you for the job.        You earned it, after all.",
"Dragonborn: It will be done.",
"Muiri: Excellent. Once Alain is dead, I'll pay you. In gold. I've saved up a       bit. I hope that'll do. But, well... There is one more thing. If you're       interested?",
"Dragonborn: I'm listening.",
"Muiri: If you can...I want you to kill someone else, as well. You don't have       to -- it's not part of our deal. But if you do...I'll pay you even more.       It's Nilsine Shatter-Shield, in Windhelm. If Nilsine dies, too...I'll       make it worth your while.",
"Tell me the full story. Why do you want Alain dead?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        I went to Windhelm to see the Shatter-Shields. They were old and dear        friends, and...in mourning. Friga was killed recently. Murdered... I        met Alain at the tavern, while I was...drinking my sadness away. He        was handsome, and charming. He said I was the 'beautiful lily' of his        dreams. Alain made all the pain just...go away. But it was all lies!        Alain used me. He ruined my name, destroyed my friendship with the        Shatter-Shields... Do you know why Alain was in Windhelm? He heard        about Friga's murder. He wanted to befriend the family in their grief        ...and rob them blind. Alain used me to get close to my friends. And        now they all think I'm some kind of...monster. Alain Dufont took my        life. And now I'm taking his.",
"And Nilsine Shatter-Shield? Why must she die?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Don't you see? I was like a daughter to Tova. A sister to Nilsine and         Friga. But the family refuses to believe my innocence. No matter what         I say. Couldn't they understand that I was used? That I was grieving         for Friga, too? No...they treated me like garbage, threw me away. With         Nilsine dead, maybe then Tova will realize what she's lost, hmm? Maybe         then she'll see that I was just as much a daughter as the others. And         if not, may she drown in her own tears.",
"Is there anything else?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        I planned to kill Alain myself, you know. Nilsine, too. But lost my        nerve. I even brewed a special poison, Lotus Extract. Maybe you could        use it? Just coat your weapon with it. Then...you get the idea.",
"Make them all pay for what they've done to me...",
"Alain: Well. You must have all those annoying gods on your side to have made       it this far, whoever you are. Even I have to admit, that's pretty       impressive.",
"Nilsine: What? Did...you need something?",
"Muiri sent me. She is quite unhappy...         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Muiri? I can't believe my family trusted that backstabbling little          strumpet. You tell her she's dead to us. You hear me? Dead!",
"Do you hear that?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|It's the sound of your sister, screaming in the Void...                        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          What kind of cruel, horrible person are you? My sister was murdered.          Do you have any idea what that's like? What I'm going through?",
"Muiri: Well, what news? Is Alain...",
"Dragonborn: Alain Dufont now lies dead.",
"Muiri: That bastard got exactly what he deserved.",
"Astrid: Ah, you're back. So, how went our first real contract? A bit more        exciting than what Nazir's been offering, I'd wager.",
"Now, I need your assistance with a matter of a more...personal nature.",
"Dragonborn: Is something wrong?",
"Astrid: It's Cicero. Ever since he arrived, his behavior's been... Well,        erratic would be an understatement. I do believe he is truly mad. But        it's worse than that. He's taken to locking himself in the Night        Mother's chamber, and talking. To someone. In hushed, but frantic        tones. Who is he speaking with? What are they planning? I fear        treachery.",
"Astrid, you're being a bit...paranoid.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Maybe so, but healthy paranoia has saved this Sanctuary before, and         my gut's telling me the demented little fool is up to something.",
"By Sithis, we must stop them!        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         So you understand my fear. If Cicero's planning something, and         conspiring with one of our own, it would be disastrous.",
"Dragonborn: What do you want me to do?",
"Astrid: Dear brother, I need you to steal into that chamber, and eavesdrop on        their meeting. It'll be no use clinging to the shadows. They'll see        you for sure. No, you need a hiding place. Somewhere they'd never        think to look. Like inside the Night Mother's coffin.",
"But that seems so...disrespectful.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Be that as it may, we have no other choice. You need to remain unseen!         Now go, before they meet.",
"Yes, the coffin. It's perfect.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         They'll never think to check it. Who in their right mind would hide         inside? Now go, before they meet.",
"And report back to me with whatever you learn.",
"Any idea who would conspire with Cicero?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         That's the real question, isn't it? The jester enters, seals the door,         and the conversation begins. So someone must be waiting for him         inside. Any one of us could enter that chamber silently. Unnoticed.         But who amongst us would dare conspire against the Sanctuary? The very         thought breaks my heart.",
"What do you think Cicero is planning?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Isn't it obvious? As the Night Mother's Keeper, he believes he's         entitled to rule of this Sanctuary. Cicero will cite our independence         as the need to rever to the Old Ways. He'll claim we're undisciplined,         unruly. Heretical, even. Ironically, the Night Mother could prove to         be just as much a victim. The queen in a fool's twisted game of chess.",
"Is there anything else I should know?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I don't believe so. But I'll be able to instruct you further after         you've returned from the chamber. It depends on what you learn. And         make haste! You must be in place before Cicero and his...ally arrive!         They could be planning another meeting any time!",
"Go. Quickly! Hide in the coffin before Cicero and the traitor meet.",
"Arnbjorn: She said that? If I find anyone working against my wife, or this          Sanctuary, I'll beat them to death with their own severed head. Of          course, they'd probably already be dead... But you know what I meant!",
"Babette: Oh! Well, I hope she doesn't suspect me. I mean, I've spoken with         Cicero a bit, and he's quite charming. But I'd never go against         Astrid. Never.",
"Festus: Ha! And would that surprise anyone? This Sanctuary's a mess. Wouldn't        surprise me if somebody's talking to the fool on the sly. Making deals.        And no, before you ask, it's not me. I know which side my bread is        buttered on.",
"Gabriella: To what end? Usurping Astrid's authority as leader of the           Sanctuary? Hmmm... Yes, I can see her concern. Thank you for           bringing this to my attention.",
"Jeezara: You're joking. While I can understand if some Family members wish to         honor the Old Ways once more, surely no one would oppose Astrid's         rule.",
"Nazir: Does she? Listen, brother... Astrid is my mistress, and I worship the       ground she walks on. But this Cicero business has her a bit...paranoid.",
"Cicero: Are we alone? Yes...yes...alone. Sweet solitude. No one will hear us,        disturb us. Everything is going according to plan. The others...I've        spoken to them. And they're coming around, I know it. The wizard,        Festus Krex...perhaps even the Argonian, and the un-child... What        about you? Have you...have you spoken to anyone? No... No, of course        not. I do the talking, the stalking, the seeing and the saying! And        what do you do? Nothing! Not...not that I'm angry! No, never! Cicero        understands. Heh. Cicero always understands! And obeys! You will talk",
"Night Mother: Poor Cicero. Dear Cicero. Such a humble servant. But he will              never hear my voice. For he is not the Listener.",
"Cicero: Oh, but how can I defend you? How can I exert your will? If you will        not speak? To anyone!",
"Night Mother: Oh, but I will speak. I will speak to you. For you are the one.              Yes, you. You who shares my iron tomb, who warms my ancient              bones. I give you this task -- journey to Volunruud. Speak with              Amaund Motierre.",
"Cicero: Poor Cicero has failed you. Poor Cicero is sorry, sweet mother. I've        tried, so very hard. But I just can't find the Listener.",
"Night Mother: Tell Cicero the time has come. Tell him the words he has been              waiting for, all these years: 'Darkness rises when silence dies.'",
"Cicero: What? What treachery! Defiler! Debaser and defiler! You have violated        the sanctity of the Night Mother's coffin! Explain yourself! Speak,        worm!",
"Dragonborn: The Night Mother spoke to me! She said 'I am the one.'",
"Cicero: She...spoke to you? More treachery! More trickery and deceit! You lie!        The Night Mother speaks only to the Listener! And there is...no...        Listener!",
"Dragonborn: Wait! She said to tell you, 'Darkness rises when silence dies.'",
"Cicero: She...she said that? She said those words...to you? 'Darkness rises        when silence dies'? But those are the words. The Binding Words. Written        in the Keeping Tomes. The signal so I would know. Mother's only way of        talking to sweet Cicero... Then...it is true! She is back! Our Lady is        back! She has chosen a Listener! She has chosen you! Ha ha ha! All        hail the Listener!",
"Astrid: By Sithis, this ends now! Back away, fool! Whatever you've been        planning is over! Are you alright? I heard the commotion. Who was        Cicero talking to? Where's the accomplice? Reveal yourself, traitor!",
"Cicero: I spoke only to the Night Mother! I spoke to the Night Mother, but she        didn't speak to me! Oh, no. She spoke only to him! To the Listener!",
"Astrid: What? The Listener? What are you going on about? What is this lunacy?",
"Cicero: It's true, it's true! The Night Mother has spoken! The silence has been        broken! The Listener has been chosen!",
"Astrid: When I heard Cicero screaming, I knew you'd been discovered. I feared        the worst. Are you all right?",
"Yes, I'm fine.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Then what in Sithis' name is going on? Cicero said he spoke to the         Night Mother, but she spoke to you? Is this just more of the fool's         rambling?",
"Dragonborn: It's true. The Night Mother spoke to me. She said I was 'the one'.",
"Astrid: What? So Cicero wasn't talking to anyone else. Just...the Night        Mother's body? And the Night Mother, who, according to everything we        know, will only speak to the person chosen as Listener...just spoke.        Right now... ...to you?",
"Dragonborn: Yes.",
"Astrid: By Sithis. And...what did she say?",
"Dragonborn: I must speak to someone named Amaund Motierre, in Volunruud.",
"Astrid: Amaund Motierre? I have no idea who that is. But Volunruud...that I        have heard of. And I know where it is.",
"Dragonborn: So I should go to Volunruud? I should talk to this man?",
"Astrid: Hmm? No. No! Listen, I don't know what's going on here, but you take        your orders from me. Are we clear on that? The Night Mother may have        spoken to you, but I am still the leader of this Family. I will not        have my authority so easily dismissed. I...I need time to think about        all this. Go see Nazir -- do some work for him. I'll find you when I'm        ready to discuss the matter further.",
"Cicero: You are the Listener! You are the Listener! I have served mother well,        I have!",
"What exactly does a Listener do?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Oh, the Listener, well...listens. The Night Mother speaks to you.         Guides you on your path. But when the Night Mother speaks, the         Listener must obey. You must! For her word is the will of Sithis.         And Sithis is the Dark Brotherhood incarnate.",
"Will the Night Mother speak to me again?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Ha! Surely you're pulling Cicero's leg! Wait...the Listener is         serious? Oh. Well of course the Night Mother will speak to you again!         She might speak now, or later, or...I don't know! But speak she will!         The Night Mother is part of you now! You get to hear voices inside         your head! The rest of us should be so lucky.",
"Cicero, did you want to be the Listener?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Oh... Well...yes. I did. I did indeed. I tried to listen. Tried so         hard. But the Night Mother never spoke to poor Cicero. The silence         became almost...maddening. Oh, but that was then! This is now! You're         the Listener, and the Night Mother chose you for a reason, I'm sure!         Cicero will remain the happy Keeper.",
"Are you excited? Oh, you should be. Things are finally looking up!",
"Dragonborn: Astrid wanted me to see you about some more work.",
"Nazir: Well then, your timing couldn't be better. As it turns out, I've got two       new contracts. One rather easy assignment, and another that should       prove quite a challenge. Your first target is an orc bard named Lurbuk.       The other is a vampire by the name of Hern. Happy hunting.",
"Tell me about Hern.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        He's a vampire, and has blended into human society for years. He's        never far from his female companion, Hert. Also a vampire. The contract        is for the male, Hern. But you'll probably have to contend with the        female, too. So for Sithis' sake, watch yourself.",
"Tell me about Lurbuk.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        He is, by all accounts, the worst bard in Skyrim. Apparently, so many        people sought his death, Astrid had to hold a lottery to determine the        client.",
"You've got people to kill, my friend. Best get to it.",
"Lurbuk: Is the line for my next performance starting already? Come on, don't        be shy. Plenty of room for everyone.",
"Someone hired the Dark Brotherhood to kill you, Lurbuk.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Ha! Oh, that's a good one, friend. Killing Lurbuk...I mean, can you         imagine something so ludicrous? Depriving the world of my unique         talents?",
"Sing me a song, bard. A song of fear, and death!        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Hmmm... All right... How about this? 'Shadow creep and, and...phantoms         leap! A man got...he got scared. And the demons dared! To um...visit         upon him all which they feared!' Brilliant, I know. It's a gift.",
"Hern: Well now. What have we here? A lost little lamb?",
"Assassin versus vampire. A fight for the ages.      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Ah, so the Brotherhood has come for old Hern, has it? Well then, let us       meet as equals.",
"Astrid: We need to talk.",
"Dragonborn: Hern is dead.",
"Nazir: No sarcasm this time. You faced a vampire, and lived to tell the tale.       Well done. And if you contracted Sanguinare Vampiris, be sure to get       that taken care of. Else you'll end up like our own Babette. Unless,       of course, that was your goal all along. Here's your payment.",
"Dragonborn: Lurbuk is dead.",
"Nazir: Wonderful. The only good bard is a dead one, as far as I'm concerned.       All that singing and...mirth. Your payment, as per the usual.",
"Arnbjorn: Oho! The Listener wants my counsel! I thought you were above the          opinions of mere mortals, now that you commune with dead old women.",
"Babette: The man you need to speak with, his name is Motierre? That's a very         old and powerful Breton family, firmly established in Cyrodiil. Most         curious...",
"Festus: So you're the Listener, hmm? Well that hardly seems fair. You just got        here. The Night Mother should have spoken to me. Any idiot could see        that. But, I will serve gladly, as that is my lot in life. Now let's        see. Ah yes, Volunruud. It's an old crypt, infested with Draugr. So        plan accordingly.",
"Gabriella: If the Night Mother truly spoke to you, if you really are the           Listener...your destiny was written in the Void. Astrid is right to           fear your power.",
"Nazir: You may be the Listener, or you may just be a lunatic who's started       hearing voices. Either way, Astrid is still your mistress. Not the       Night Mother.",
"Veezara: Just remember Astrid's commitment to her Sanctuary, to her Family. A         Family that now counts you as one of its own. Honor Astrid above all         others.",
"Amaund: By the Almighty Divines. You've come. You've actually come. This        dreadful Black Sacrament thing...it worked.",
"The Night Mother heard your pleas, Motierre.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Yes, um... So it would seem. Well, I won't waste your time.",
"You have opened the door to darkness, little man.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Oh, I know. I know. But I'm so glad you're here. Please, allow me to         state my business. Surely your time is as valuable as my own.",
"Dragonborn: Go on.",
"Amaund: As I said, I want you to kill several people. You'll find the targets,        as well as their manners of elimination, quite varied. I'm sure someone        of your disposition will probably find it enjoyable. But you should        know that these killings are but a means to an end. For they pave the        way to the most important target. The real reason I'm speaking with a        cutthroat in the bowels of this detestable crypt. For I seek the        assassination of... ...the Emperor.",
"Leaders rise and fall. Business is business.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Oh, wonderful. You don't know how happy I am to hear you say that.",
"You want us to kill...the Emperor. Of Tamriel?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         That is correct. What I ask is no small thing, of course. But you         represent the Dark Brotherhood. This is...what you do? No? You must         understand.",
"So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. It's        as if the very stars have finally aligned. But I digress... Here, they        need to be delivered to your, um...superior. Rexus. The items.",
"Rexus: Here. Here.",
"Amaund: Rexus will now give you two items which must be passed along to your        superior. The sealed letter will explain everything that needs to be        done. The amulet is quite valuable -- you can use it to pay for any        and all expenses.",
"Amaund: Was there...something else you need?",
"Who are you, Motierre? Who are you, really?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I performed the Black Sacrament, contacted you people, because I         thought you guaranteed discretion. Is this no longer so?",
"Why do this? Why have the Emperor assassinated?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         In the year 3E 41, Emperor Pelagius Septim was murdered in the Temple         of the One in the Imperial City. Cut down by a Dark Brotherhood         assassin. His killing ushered in, shall we say, a necessary change in         Imperial policy. There are those now who wish for a similar change. I         am sorry, but that's all I'm at liberty to say.",
"We'll require...significant compensation. Can you pay the price?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Oh, my furtive friend. When Emperor Titus Mede II lies dead, there         will be gold...a fortune in gold. But so much more! It is said that         the Dark Brotherhood, in recent times, has been in decline. That you         lack the power, wealth, and respect of days past. Is it not so? If you         do this, if you kill the Emperor... Oh, how the masses will fear and         respect you.",
"You can trust your servant to keep this secret?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Oh, Rexus is no mere servant. He has been with the Motierre family         since I was a child. I trust the man with my life.",
"You must deliver those items to your superior. And I...I must get out        of this foul place.",
"Astrid: You're back. Good. All right, so? Did you meet this Motierre? What        did he want?",
"Dragonborn: Motierre wants us...to kill the Emperor.",
"Astrid: You're joking.",
"The letter explains it all. The amulet is for expenses.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          By Sithis, you're not joking. To kill the Emperor of Tamriel...the          Dark Brotherhood hasn't done such a thing since the assassination of          Pelagius. As a matter of fact, no one has dared assassinate an          Emperor of Tamriel since the murder of Uriel Septim, and that was          two hundred years ago...",
"Dragonborn: Surely the Night Mother wouldn't misdirect us...",
"Astrid: No, she certainly wouldn't. And...for whatever reason, she chose to        relay Motierre's information to you. I don't know exactly what's going        on here, if you're the Listener, or this is some kind of fluke, or        what. But what we now have before us...",
"Dragonborn: So we'll accept the contract?",
"Astrid: You're damn right we'll accept it. If we pull this off, the Dark        Brotherhood will know fear and respect we haven't seen in centuries.        You think I'd abandon an opportunity to lead my Family to glory? But        this is all so much to take in. I need time to read the letter, and        figure out where we go from here. And this amulet. Hmmm...",
"Dragonborn: What are you thinking?",
"Astrid: I'm thinking we need that amulet appraised. I want to know where it        came from, how much it's worth, and if we can actually get away with        selling it. And, there's only one man who can give us what we need --        Delvin Mallory. He's a fence, a private operator. Works out of the        Ratway, in Riften. Give me the letter. Bring Mallory the amulet. Find        out everything you can, and sell it if he's willing. He'll offer a        letter of credit -- that's fine. Delvin Mallory and the Dark        Brotherhood have...history. He can be trusted.",
"Delvin: Somethin' you need? Anything for the Guild.Delvin: Ah, now you must be lost. Best ya scurry off while you're able. The        Ratway, well, it has a habit of swallowin' up the uninvited.",
"Dragonborn: Actually, I'm here on Dark Brotherhood business.Dragonborn: The Dark Brotherhood requires your services.",
"Delvin: Oh. Oh I see.",
"What can you tell me about this? (Give Delvin the amulet)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Let's see... Where oh where did you get this? Don't answer -- I don't         want to know. This is an amulet of the Emperor's Elder Council.         Specially crafted for each member. Worth a small fortune. Ain't         somethin' you'd give up lightly. Look, it ain't my business ta tell         the Dark Brotherhood its business, but if you killed a member of the         Elder Council, you'd better belie--",
"Dragonborn: Will you buy it?",
"Delvin: Buy it? This? An Elder Council amulet? Oh yes. Oh yes, indeed. Wait        just a moment... Here. It's a letter of credit. Usable, by Astrid only,        for any service or item I can provide. As per our standard arrangement.        You bring that back to your lovely mistress. With my regards.",
"Astrid: Good, you're back. Well, what did Mallory have to say? Is the amulet        authentic?",
"Dragonborn: Yes, and specially made for members of the Elder Council.",
"Astrid: The Elder Council... Oh, now that explains quite a bit. Motierre, you        naughty, naughty boy. Hiring the Dark Brotherhood to help you rise        beyond your station. Delicious. Was Mallory willing to buy the amulet?",
"Dragonborn: He was. Here's a letter of credit.",
"Astrid: Splendid. Then we're ready to begin. Or, specifically, you're ready to        begin. After all, you're the one the Night Mother spoke to. Now then.        I hope you have something nice to wear. Because you're going to a        wedding.",
"Dragonborn: A wedding?",
"Astrid: Well, more like the public reception. It should be a lovely affair.        You'll mingle with the guests, eat some cake...stab the bride. Oh yes.        You've got to kill the bride. At her wedding. And they say romance is        dead.",
"Who's the target?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Her name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's         business holdings in Solitude. The wedding is being held in that city,         at the Temple of the Divines. Her death will cause an uproar, which is         exactly what we want. Vici is likely to address her guests frequently,         as is the wedding custom. Kill her when she does that, and I promise         you a significant bonus. Now go. And give my best to the bride.",
"Enough talk. Just tell me who to kill.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Very well. The target's name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East         Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude. The wedding is being         held in that city, at the Temple of the Divines. Remember, we want         people to notice. Kill Vici while she's addressing her guests, as is         the custom, and I can promise a bonus. Now go. And give the bride a         special kiss, from me.",
"Can you provide any more details on the contract?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         This is a public kill. How you do it is entirely up to you. Arrow to         the throat? Knife in the belly? Your choice, so long as it's loud and         messy. Because of the current political climate, people are going to         assume the murder is related to the bad blood between the Legion and         Stormcloaks. In any event, when Vici dies, it's going to be complete         pandemonium. Best have your escape route planned out in advance.",
"What's Vici's connection to the Emperor?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         An excellent question. Vittoria Vici is the first cousin to our dear         Emperor, Titus Mede II. Vici has obvious Imperial connections. Her         husband has ties to the Stormcloaks. Their union is a step toward         reconciliation. So if there's a murder at the wedding... Not only         will it stall the peace process -- it will send shockwaves throughout         the entire Empire. The Emperor's hand will be forced. He'll have to         travel to Skyrim to deal with the aftermath...and he'll find the Dark         Brotherhood waiting.",
"Why isn't the Emperor attending the wedding?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Hmph. He had a trip to Skyrim planned for months, and canceled at the          last minute. Much to his cousin's dismay. Seems the Emperor realized          his presence would necessitate a more direct role in the ongoing          hostilities. A role he was, obviously, unwilling to take. All that          will change with his cousin's murder. Everyone will think it was          motivated by the conflict between the Imperial Legion and          Stormcloaks. And the Emperor will be forced to come clean up the          mess.",
"Off to Solitude with you. Time to give the Emperor some real motivation        to visit Skyrim.",
"Arnbjorn: You got to kill a soft little woman on her wedding day? What's next?          Murdering a crippled orphan in his sleep?",
"Babette: It's no fair. I love weddings. Astrid should have given this contract         to me. Instead, she's got me visiting cities, assessing security. How         boring. But listen, I think I can help you. The wedding reception is         outside the Temple of the Divines, right? In Solitude? If so, the         bride will probably address the crowd from the balcony. It overlooks         the courtyard. Well, there's an old statue there. I've seen it.          Hanging right over where she'll be standing. Old means weak. Weak         means it could fall. Hmmm?",
"Festus: Ah, killing her will be easy. She'll be so happy, she'll never see it        coming. I should know, I killed a bride once. It was our honeymoon.        Tepid, I said! The bathwater should be tepid! Lukewarm is not tepid!        Close, maybe, but there is a difference! Stupid cow.",
"Gabriella: I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of surveying the site           of the reception. There's a small parapet, just opposite the           balcony, that would prove an excellent spot for a long-range kill.           I left something there for you. If you're inclined to take that           approach.",
"Nazir: Slaughtering the Emperor's cousin? At her wedding? Those guards will be       out for blood. Wouldn't surprise me if the crowd jumped in too.",
"Veezara: Your contract sound simple, which means it certainly will not be.         Getting into that reception will be easy, but have you thought about         getting out?",
"Vittoria: What an amazing day this has been. I hope you've been enjoying the          festivities. I'm...I'm just so overwhelmed. Such kindness...for me.",
"The Stormcloaks say hello!          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Oh! Well, you tell your Stormcloak friends 'hello' right back at           them! This is a day of healing! Legion, Stormcloaks -- all are           welcome here!",
"Hail the Imperial Legion!          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Ha ha ha ha! Yes, yes indeed! Hail the Imperial Legion! Hail the           Stormcloaks! Hail Solitude and the Eight Divines! On this glorious           day, we honor everyone! Ha ha ha ha!",
"Vittoria: Good people of Solitude. I just wanted to thank you all for being          here. To thank you for sharing this wonderfully happy day with          myself, and my new husband. Today, the problems of Skyrim are not my          problems. Nor are they yours. Today we are joined in peace and          happiness. So please, enjoy yourselves. I thank you all again for          making this the best wedding a woman could ask for.",
"Asgeir Snow-Shod: What in the...? Vittoria! No!",
"Nura Snow-Shod: Aiiiieeeeeeee!",
"Alexia Vici: No! Noooooo!",
"Pantea: The bride has been murdered! Somebody help!",
"Veezara: Astrid ordered me to keep an eye on you. Figured you could use a hand         when the chaos erupted. I'll try to hold them off as best I can. You         get back to the Sanctuary.",
"Astrid: Ha ha! The news is everywhere! Vittoria Vici, the Emperor's cousin,        butchered at her own wedding! Well done! Let's see his eminence try to        ignore this.",
"Now then, time to proceed to the next stage of the plan. Go and speak         with Gabriella. She's been helping me arrange your next contract.",
"Veezara: Ah, you're back. It was good to fight alongside you. I'm sure people         won't be forgetting that wedding anytime soon, hmm?",
"Gabriella: Dear brother. I've been waiting for you. Your next contract awaits,           as I'm sure Astrid indicated.",
"Dragonborn: She did. What are the details?",
"Gabriella: With the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, his security           service, the Penitus Oculatus, will need to begin its preparations           immediately. Security is being handled by a Commander Maro. Astrid           and I have devised a plan to break the man, and in doing so, cripple           the Emperor's protection. You are to slay the commander's son, Gaius           Maro, and once he is dead, plant false evidence on him, implicating           him in a plot to kill the Emperor.",
"He is set to leave the Penitus Oculatus outpost at Dragon Bridge,           and inspect the security of each city in Skyrim. Go there now.           Observe Gaius Maro's departure, and follow him. Waylay him in one           of the cities, and send his soul to Sithis. Once he's dead, plant           the incriminating letter on his body, and let fate take care of the           rest. Oh, and one final thing...",
"Dragonborn: Yes?",
"Gabriella: To earn your bonus, do not kill Gaius Maro in Dragon Bridge, or on           the road. Kill him in one of the other major cities he'll be           visiting. There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the           letter implicating Gaius Maro in the plot to assassinate the           Emperor. Do that, and Astrid has authorized me to grant you a rather           unique bonus. It is a special token, to be given to Olava the           Feeble, in Whiterun. Olava is an old and dear friend, and a powerful           seer. The token entitles you to a reading of your future. It's an           opportunity one should not pass up.",
"What will killing Gaius Maro accomplish?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Killing Commander Maro would do no good. Someone would merely            replace him. No, we need him to remain in charge. But...distracted.            Weakened. Implicate and kill his son Gaius, and the commander will            be grief-stricken and humiliated, his family name ruined. The            security plan will then fail. Best yet, the Emperor will be lulled            into a false sense of security, thinking an assassination plot had            already been discovered and foiled.",
"Tell me about Dragon Bridge.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            It's a small town, with one rather unique feature -- it houses            Skyrim's only Penitus Oculatus outpost. It was established by            Commander Maro when he first arrived in Skyrim, several months ago.            When he began preparing for the Emperor's initial visit.",
"Do you know Gaius Maro's schedule?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            No, so your best plan is to follow him after he leaves Dragon            Bridge. However, there is one other option... We know there's an            actual written travel schedule, somewhere in the Penitus Oculatus            outpost. Securing that would, obviously, be most beneficial...",
"Walk in Gaius Maro's shadow, and deliver to him the judgment of           Sithis.",
"Astrid: I've taken the liberty of visiting the cities, and spreading some nasty        rumors about Gaius Maro. To make his treachery that much more        believable.",
"Arnbjorn: What's the matter, Listener? The Night Mother not feeling very chatty          these days? You need help from your flesh and blood lessers? You've          got to track a man, kill him, and then frame him for a crime. This          contract's perfect...for me. Clearly, my lovely wife made a mistake.",
"Babette: Normally I talk to a victim before I end his life, but I wouldn't         recommend it this time. Maro will be alert to danger. Talking may         spook him.",
"Festus: Remember, your target is Gaius Maro, the son. Not Commander Maro, the        father! We need him alive. But the son... Ha! Scorch his face off!",
"Nazir: Killing Gaius Maro in a city will be challenging because of all the       guards, but fights, even murder, are fairly common. Killing him secretly       will certainly make things easier on you, but if there are witnesses,       so be it.",
"Veezara: Astrid had me investigate the Penitus Oculatus. Their members are         highly trained, effective warriors. Be on your guard, brother.",
"Gaius: Father, you worry too much. I'll be fine.",
"Commander Maro: I know you will. But all the same, remember everything I said.                Stay alert, and when you get to the cities, make your                observations and move on.",
"Gaius: I understand. But you're being paranoid. I'm inspecting security, not       charging off into battle. There's not a lot that can go wrong.",
"Commander Maro: Son, when the Emperor's safety is concerned, anything could go                wrong. Off with you, now. And good travels.",
"Gaius: Farewell, father. I'll return as soon as I'm able.",
"Faida: Well, this is it, then. Look after yourself, Gaius. You're doing your       duty, and I'm proud of you. But you'd better come back to me. You hear?",
"Gaius: Oh, Faida. I may travel alone, but you know I carry you always in my       heart. I'll see you soon.",
"Gaius: Keep back, citizen. I have important business I must attend to.",
"After I kill you, I'm going to kill the Emperor.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        What? Filthy assassin! We'll see who lies dead!",
"Traveling alone can be so dangerous...       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Is that a threat? Back off, or by the Eight I'll cleave that arrogant        head off its shoulders.",
"Gabriella: Ah, at last. I've been anxiously awaiting your return.",
"Dragonborn: Gaius Maro is dead.",
"Gabriella: Yes, I know. As does Astrid.",
"But you should know that we have a more pressing matter to deal           with. It's...Cicero. There's been an incident. You should proceed           into the Sanctuary. I'll let Astrid explain.",
"Babette: Just try to relax, Veezara. Let the elixir do its work. You'll feel         better, shortly.",
"Veezara: Achh... Thank you, dear. You are most kind. The jester's cut feels as         bad as it looks, I'm afraid.",
"Astrid: Damn it, this never should have happened! We knew better. We knew        better, and still we let our guards down. Agh!",
"Festus: I'll admit, even I'm having a hard time disagreeing with you...",
"Astrid: Maro is dead, I know. But we've got bigger problems right now!",
"Dragonborn: Gabriella mentioned something about Cicero...",
"Astrid: The fool went absolutely berserk! He wounded Veezara, he tried to kill        me, and then he fled. I knew that lunatic couldn't be trusted.",
"Festus: It's true, I'm afraid. Cicero was a little whirlwind, slashing this        way and that. It would have been funny, if he weren't trying to murder        us all.",
"Nazir: Don't forget the ranting and raving. About the Night Mother, how she       was the true leader of the Dark Brotherhood and Astrid was just a       'pretender.'",
"Astrid: Look, we've got to deal with this situation. You've got to deal with        this situation.",
"Dragonborn: What do you want me to do?",
"Astrid: I want you to find that miserable little fool and end his life! But        first...find my husband. Make sure he's all right. After the attack,        Arnbjorn flew into a rage. When Cicero left...Arnbjorn went after him.        They disappeared into the wild. Search Cicero's room. Maybe there's        something in there that sheds some light on where he might have gone.        Let me know the minute you find something. I've got to see to Veezara,        and calm everyone down.",
"Veezara: Bested by a fool. Who's the fool now, hmm?",
"Babette: Hush, Veezara. You were very brave. Astrid may well be dead if not         for you.",
"Astrid: She's right. I'll be forever in your debt, dearest brother. Now be        quiet. Just...just rest.",
"Astrid: That twisted jester will pay for what he's done...",
"Isn't there any way to work this out?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Look, the Dark Brotherhood is a family. This Sanctuary is a family.         And, we've always welcome those...shunned by society. Werewolves,         wizards, eternal ten-year-old vampires...what does it matter? In         truth, I've rarely met a lunatic I haven't liked. Cicero's problem         isn't his madness. It's an adherence to an ancient, outmoded way of         life. The Night Mother's ways...simply are not our ways. He just         couldn't accept that. And now he'll have to pay the price.",
"Did something set Cicero off?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         No, nothing. At least nothing I'm aware of. Well... If I'm being         honest, I haven't exactly been discreet lately in expressing my         frustration with this whole situation. Obeying the Night Mother. You         being the Listener. It's ridiculous. No offense. Cicero may have heard         me talking to one of the others about the Night Mother. It's possible         I was...not entirely respectful. But to go this far. To attempt to         murder the leader of the Sanctuary. Cicero must pay with his life.         There is no other option.",
"Damnable jester...",
"Babette: I believed in Cicero. But he's betrayed us all.Babette: Cicero destroyed any sympathy I may have had for him when he wounded         Veezara. Kill the fool and be done with it. Go. Do what has to be         done.",
"Festus: Boy, did you miss all the excitement.Festus: All right, so maybe I was wrong. Maybe Cicero coming here wasn't the        best thing that could have happened. But even I didn't anticipate this.        Well, you know the old saying. When life gives you lemons... ...go        murder a clown. Burn that little jester alive.",
"Gabriella: It was a truly terrifying scene. Beautiful, in some respects.Gabriella: I feel only pity for Cicero. He must die, of course, but can any           of us truly blame him for his actions? We mocked him, disrespected           the Old Ways. Our actions were shameful. Surely the Night Mother           weeps this day.",
"Nazir: Should have figured the little lunatic would completely snap.Nazir: Going after Cicero now would be a fool's errand. That little jester is       currently being digested in Arnbjorn's stomach, mark my words.",
"Veezara: It only hurts when I laugh. He he he. Oww...Veezara: Yes, do not underestimate Cicero. A man like that, small and foolish,         is easy to mock. To underestimate. Don't make the same mistake I did.",
"Astrid: Have you found something?",
"Dragonborn: Yes, Cicero's journal.",
"Astrid: Good, good. Does it say where he may be headed?",
"Dragonborn: Yes, an abandoned Sanctuary in Dawnstar. I have the passphrase.",
"Astrid: The Dawnstar Sanctuary? Whatever for? Never mind, it doesn't matter.        You need to leave. Now. Every moment counts, so I want you to take my        horse. His name is Shadowmere. You'll find him outside, by the pool.        Let's just say he's...one of us. Find Arnbjorn. Make sure my husband's        all right. And then send that jester's twisted little soul to the Void,        in as many pieces as possible.",
"Dragonborn: What do we know of the Dawnstar Sanctuary?",
"Astrid: Oh, it's ancient. Apparently one of the first Sanctuaries in Skyrim.        It hasn't been used by the Brotherhood in close to a hundred years. If        you say Cicero has gone there, then it stands to reason that he's        familiar with the place. That means you'll be fighting him on his own        ground. Tread carefully.",
"Arnbjorn: Should have figured Astrid would send you.",
"Dragonborn: You're hurt.",
"Arnbjorn: What gave it away? Ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah, got to admit that little          jester's good with that butter knife. But don't worry, I gave as          good as I got.",
"Dragonborn: Where's Cicero now?",
"Arnbjorn: In there! Through the door. Some old Sanctuary, by the looks of it.          I would have followed him, but I don't know the phrase.",
"Dragonborn: I know the phrase. I'll get Cicero -- you go home.",
"Arnbjorn: All right, you convinced me. Doubt I'll be much good to you, anyway.          The little fop cut me pretty deep. But I slashed him good. Pretty          sure I severed an artery. Don't know what you're going to find in          there...but you can probably just follow the blood. Do me a favor          and kill that little jester twice. Just to make sure.",
"Cicero: Listener! Is that you? Oh, I knew you'd come. Send the best to defeat        the best. Astrid knew her stupid wolf couldn't slay sly Cicero.",
"Cicero: Oh, but this isn't at all what mother would want. You kill the Keeper        or I kill the Listener? Now that's madness.",
"Cicero: Ouch! Pointy pointy! My home is well defended. I always have been a        stickler for details. Get it? 'Stick-ler.' Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, I        slay me!",
"Cicero: You're...still alive. Cicero respects the listener's abilities, of        course, but could you at least slow down a bit? I'm not what I used        to be. Heh.",
"Cicero: Brrr! Chilly! You'll enjoy this. Not an original part of the Sanctuary,        per se. Let's call it a 'forced addition.' Forced by what? Oh, come        and see!",
"Cicero: All right, so Cicero attacked that harlot, Astrid! But what's a fool        to do, when his mother is slandered and mocked? Surely the Listener        understands!",
"Cicero: Cicero admits, he thought the Listener would be dead by now. Heh. Maybe        we can just forget all this? Hmm? Let bygones be bygones? What do you        say?",
"Cicero: If it's any comfort, I do feel slightly bad about Veezara. Stupid        lizard got in my way! But please tell me that hulking sheepdog has        bled to death.",
"Cicero: And now we come to the end of our play. The grand finale.",
"Cicero: You caught me! I surrender! Ha ha ha ha.",
"There is only one cure for your madness, Cicero. Me.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Oh, I like that! Very good, very good! Creative! But killing me would         be a mistake! Oh yes. You would displease our mother, hmm? For she's         your mother too, isn't she...Listener? Walk away! Let poor Cicero         live! Tell the pretender Astrid you did the job! Stabbed, strangled,         drowned poor Cicero! One little itty bitty lie!",
"Time to die, traitor!        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Traitor? Me? Silly assassin. So confused, so confused...and they say         I'm mad! If I'm a traitor, so are you! Have you not heard the          maiden's voice? Are you not the Listener? So walk away! Let poor         Cicero live! Tell Astrid you did the job! Stabbed, strangled, drowned         poor Cicero! A tiny white lie for a dark assassin!",
"Do what you will. Cicero has no fight left. In the end, Sithis will        judge us both.",
"Cicero: Coming...Mother...",
"Astrid: Arnbjorn is safe, and for that you have my thanks. But what of the        fool? Is Cicero dead?",
"Yes, Cicero is dead. / Yes, Cicero is dead. (Lie)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Excellent. Once again, you've proven yourself a born assassin. Tell        you what. Why don't you hold onto Shadowmere a while longer? He's a        fine steed, and hasn't been ridden as nearly as much as he should        lately. And now that this Cicero mess has been mopped up, we can get        back to the matter at hand, hmm?",
"Dragonborn: Right. So what's my next task?",
"Astrid: There's just one more target before we strike out at the Emperor. Have        you by chance heard of the 'Gourmet'? Read his cookbook? It's become        quite a phenomenon. The Gourmet is scheduled to cook for the Emperor        at a special dinner. You'll kill him, steal his Writ of Passage, and        assume the roll¹ of master chef. Festus has been spearheading this        part of the assassination plan. He's close to discovering the identity        of the Gourmet. You should report to him.",
"Arnbjorn: There you are. Look, I...I just wanted to say thanks for coming to          find me. Back in Dawnstar. Crazy jester finally met his match, am I          right?",
"Festus: There you are. Took your sweet time dealing with Cicero, hmph? Now        let's get down to business. Astrid told you about the Gourmet, I hope?",
"Dragonborn: That I need to kill him and take on his identity?",
"Festus: Quite so. But first you'll need to learn who he is. Assuming, of        course, that the Gourmet actually is a 'he.' Could be a woman for all",
"So you don't even know who the Gourmet is? Wonderful.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Don't be so petulant!",
"Do you have any idea how I might find out?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Ah, indeed I do! Indeed I do!",
"In my, um, investigations, I came upon this. It's a copy of the        Gourmet's cookbook. Ah, but not just any copy. It's signed you see!        Seems to be a message from the Gourmet to one Anton Virane. I've        tracked Virane to the keep in Markarth. It would seem he's the cook.",
"Dragonborn: And this Anton Virane knows the Gourmet's true identity?",
"Festus: I believe so. Therefore, you need to obtain that information from        Virane -- who the Gourmet is, and where he can be found. Oh, and when        you're done with Virane, kill him. Loose ends and all that. Next,        you'll have to... Are you still paying attention?",
"As I was saying... You'll need to kill the Gourmet, of course. But        what's more, you'll need to get his Writ of Passage, so you can take        his place. Oh, and if you can, hide his body. The longer it takes for        anyone else to determine his real identity, the better. Now off with        you!",
"What else can you tell me about the Gourmet?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Nobody knows his true identity. Well, nobody except Gaius Maro, and         you've already taken care of him. I do know the Gourmet was         classically trained in traditional Breton cuisine in High Rock. So         that's where he must have met Anton Virane. In any event, our         anonymous chef shares a passion for food with all of Tamriel. And         that anonymity will prove the Emperor's undoing.",
"Tell me about this cookbook.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         'Uncommon Taste.' It was published a few years ago, and became a         sensation throughout the Empire almost overnight. The recipes were         hailed as both practical and decadent. I've made a few of the         Gourmet's dishes myself, actually. His roast mutton with Redguard         berry sauce is to die for. But his chocolate pate¹ gives me the runs.",
"So the Gourmet is in Skyrim?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Yes. Gaius Maro, on orders from his father, arranged for the Gourmet         to come to Skyrim months ago. To serve as the Emperor's personal         chef. But the Emperor cancelled his journey at the last minute. Maro         was smart, kept the Gourmet around, in case things changed. And so,         the Gourmet has remained in seclusion, somewhere in Skyrim...on         indefinite hold. Probably feels like a prisoner. But you'll fix that.",
"Remember, the Markarth Keep. That's where you'll find Anton Virane.        Probably cooking up all of the Gourmet's recipes, passing them off as        his own.",
"Astrid: Believe it or not, Festus likes you. He senses your power, your        potential. Follow his instructions to the letter, and you may even        earn his respect.",
"Arnbjorn: The last thing you need is my help. Listener or not, you have proven          yourself time and again. To Astrid, to the Family...and to me.",
"Babette: Yes -- don't kill the Gourmet! Oh, I know you have to, but it makes         me sad all the same. I love the Gourmet's recipes. The world will         soon be a blander, last flavorful place.",
"Gabriella: You've been directed to dispose of the Gourmet's body, is that           correct? I often find water to be a suitable hiding place. A lake,           a pool...the sea.",
"Nazir: Hmph. I wouldn't worry too much about this Virane giving you the       information you need. Give him a good scare, and he'll squawk like a       Hagraven. That said... If your attack on Virane is witnessed, those       Markarth guards are going to be none too happy...",
"Veezara: Hmmm... Well, assuming this Gourmet is just a cook, it will probably         be an easy kill. Just be discreet -- alerting others will be the real         threat.",
"Anton: Yes, yes, for the hundredth time, I am a Breton. I was born in High       Rock. And then I came here. I am not a Reachman!",
"Dragonborn: The Gourmet. Who is he? Where is he?",
"Anton: The...the Gourmet? Never! I don't know what led you here, but nothing       will betray my trust. I'll take the secret of the Gourmet's identity to       my grave.",
"For the Dark Brotherhood, that can be easily arranged. (Intimidate)       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        The Dark Brotherhood? Now...now wait a minute. Let's not be hasty. I        mean, surely my friend wouldn't want me to endanger my own life. Right?        Look, his name is Balagog gro-Nolob. He's an Orc! The Gourmet's an Orc!        He's staying at the Nightgate Inn! That's all I know! Now...now you'll        let me go. Right?",
"Of course, Anton. Thank you. (Lie)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Okay. All right. Wonderful. You're welcome! I'll just be on my way,         then...",
"Balagog: Whatever it is, I'm sure I can't be of help. I'm just here on...         holiday.",
"You served your last meal...Gourmet.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Gourmet? Why I... Um... Oh dear. You're going to kill me now, aren't          you?",
"Soon, the Emperor will die. Murdered, by the Gourmet.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          What? The Emperor? But I... Oh. Oh, by the gods, no. No, you can't          do this. You can't!",
"Festus: So, the prodigal murderer returns. And the Gourmet?",
"Dragonborn: Dead.",
"Festus: So I gathered. It seems a certain Orc has disappeared. Which means you        not only killed the Gourmet, but disposed of the body as well. You've        got the Writ of Passage too, I see. Splendid, splendid... Ah, and word        has come in from Markarth that the keep's cook has met an untimely        demise. You performed your duties to the letter.",
"Hmph. I was wrong about you. I see that now. Maybe we all were.",
"Here's your payment. And...a little something extra, as well. From me.        Consider it my way of apologizing. For being so damned curmudgeonly!        It's called the Nightweaver's Band. I wore this for years. I want you        to have it now. It'll give your magic and sneakiness some much needed        'oomph.' Now, you better get a move on and see Astrid. It's time! Time        for the final stage of this grand and glorious operation!",
"Festus: Good, good. And you've got the Writ of Passage, too, I see. So        there's that. I also received word from Markarth. It would seem Anton        Virane has suffered an untimely fate, as well. Good. But        unfortunately, that inn is abuzz with the news of somebody killing        one of their guests! What, hiding the body was too much for you to        handle? Bah! Useless. Here's your gold. Now go see Astrid. The time to        move against the Emperor has finally come. Sithis help us all.",
"Astrid: So it's done. You've killed the Gourmet. And now Titus Mede II is as        good as dead.",
"Dragonborn: So it's time? We're ready to assassinate the Emperor?",
"Astrid: Oh yes. And I've decided you will have the honor.",
"The Emperor will die! For Sithis and the Night Mother!        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Yes. For Sithis...and the Night Mother. You are the Listener after         all, hmm? So let's not waste any more time.",
"Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Writ of        Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro. I'm sure you remember        him. You'll gain unrestricted access to the kitchens, and then the        Emperor. You're posing as a chef, so you'll be able to poison his meal        rather easily.",
"Dragonborn: Which poison I should use?",
"Astrid: Here, take this -- it's called Jarrin Root. All it takes is one taste,        and the effects are quite immediate. The Emperor will be serving        Sithis before he even knows he's dead. Once Mede has been killed,        escape through the upper door, and across the bridge. I've 'arranged'        for it to be unguarded once the alarm is sounded. Now go, my friend.        Go, and fulfill your destiny as Listener.",
"What else can you tell me about Jarrin Root?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         It's a rare plant, found only on the island of Stros M'Kai. It can be         served like any vegetable -- cut up, put in a salad, perhaps boiled         in a stew. One taste will lead to nearly instant death, so don't even         think about it.",
"Anything else before I set off?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         It took all the favors, bribes, and blackmails I could muster, but         I've secured your exit out of the keep. Just follow my instructions,         and the Dark Brotherhood will be back on top. All thanks to you...         Listener.",
"Arnbjorn: You get to kill the Emperor. The bloody Emperor. You'd better enjoy          this one. You owe us all that much. So make it bloody, painful, and          spectacular.",
"Babette: Don't take any chances with this one. Use the Jarrin Root to poison         the Emperor's food. You're disguising yourself as a chef -- it only         makes sense.",
"Festus: Ah, good to see you, brother. Gearing up to kill the Emperor? Exciting        times. Exciting times, indeed. Well... While it's true I prefer        sorcery's more destructive nuances, we mustn't forget the many spells        with simpler, more practical applications. Sure, you poison the        Emperor, but what then? Why not summon an atronach and cause some        chaos? Or turn invisible and slip away? Use your imagination!",
"Gabriella: What an honor, the assassination of an Emperor. And all because you           are the Listener, favored by the Night Mother, anointed by Sithis.           I am so very happy for you. If not a bit...envious.",
"Nazir: Yes. You're killing the Emperor himself. The Dark Brotherhood will get       one shot at this, and you've been given the honors. So don't screw up.",
"Veezara: Astrid has arranged for your escape, no? Then you have nothing to         worry about. Get in, kill the Emperor, and get out. Then, we         celebrate.",
"Agent 1: This city is crawling with Imperial Legion, and you know what? I'm         still nervous. Lazy and useless, the lot of them. They can't even         keep the Stormcloaks in line. No way I trust them with the Emperor's         life.",
"Agent 2: You worry too much. The Emperor's never been safer. You think         assassination attempts are planned overnight? We discovered the plot.         End of threat.",
"Agent 1: I suppose. But what about the old man? Son killed, family name         ruined...and he acts as if nothing even happened. Think he's even fit         for duty?",
"Agent 2: I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that. Commander Maro is the best         the Penitus Oculatus has ever produced. You should be half the man he         is.",
"Agent 1: You misunderstand. It's just...I feel for him, is all. To carry a         weight like that. It's got to take its toll. That happened to me,          I'd be a wreck.",
"Maro: Stop right there. The tower is off limits until further notice.",
"But please, don't let me keep you. Proceed to the kitchens straight       away. Gianna, the castle chef, has been eagerly awaiting your arrival.",
"Gianna: Not another delivery. I told you people, our stocks are fine. Now put        whatever you have over there, then get out!",
"Dragonborn: You misunderstand. For I am...the Gourmet!",
"Gianna: The...Gourmet? Oh! Finally! When I heard the Gourmet was being brought        in to cook for the Emperor, I could hardly believe it. It's just...",
"Dragonborn: Yes?",
"Gianna: • You're a Nord! I never would have guessed it! But where in the world          did you learn to cook like that? Here in Skyrim? Or maybe somewhere          less...",
"Silence! I am ready to prepare the grand feast!          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Oh. Well, um, actually...you're not. Wearing a chef's hat, I mean.          There's one right over there on the shelf. You can't very well cook          without it.",
"Oh, just look at you. Absolutely brilliant. Now...now you're just as          I imagined.",
"Dragonborn: Enough! The Gourmet is here to cook, not talk! Let us begin.",
"Gianna: Oh! Yes, but of course. Ahem. The Emperor has requested your signature        dish -- the Potage le Magnifique. I've taken the liberty of getting it        started. But the cookbook only says so much, and everyone makes the        Potage differently. I would be honored if we could make it...the        Gourmet's special way. The base broth is already boiled. We can get        started right now. So... Which ingredient should I add next?",
"Carrots.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Carrots? Really? Okay... What next?",
"The next ingredient is...vampire dust.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Vampire dust? Seriously? Hmm... Yes, I guess I can see how that would         add a more...earthy texture. And, oddly enough, we do have some on         hand... All right, what next then?",
"You must now add a splash of mead.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Ah, of course. I suspected as much.",
"We shall now add...a giant's toe!        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         A...giant's toe? You're...sure about that?",
"One nirnroot.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Really? Oh, I use Nirnroot as a special seasoning all the time as         well. What a wonderful idea. Okay, now what?",
"You must now add...a septim.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         A Septim? As in...a gold coin? Really? Ah, I see now. The would give         the Potage le Magnifique a slightly metallic -- but delicious --         aftertaste. Simply Brilliant. I have to say, the stew seems done.",
"Diced horker meat.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Hmmm...horker. So delicious. I swear, is there a soul alive who         doesn't enjoy the taste of... Sorry, I didn't mean to get carried         away. There we go, one cup of diced horker meat. I have to say, the        stew seems done.",
"Add anything else, and we may dilute the distinct flavors. So...is        that it?",
"We're done. Let us serve...the Potage le Magnifique!        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Excellent. They should be ready for us now.",
"There is one final ingredient. Here, add this. (Give jarrin root)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Oh? What is this, some kind of herb? Are you sure? The Potage tastes         perfect as it is. Any other ingredient might...",
"Now, now, Gianna. Who's the Gourmet here?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Heh, I'm sorry. Of course. It's your most famous recipe, after all.          All right then, your secret ingredient's been added.",
"And I may say so...it has been an honor, getting a chance to prepare a        meal with, well...the best chef in the entire Empire.",
"Gianna: I'll carry the stew pot, and lead the way up to the dining room. I'm        sure the Emperor and his guests are dying to meet you.",
"Noblewoman: But aren't you the least bit nervous? After everything that's            happened?",
"Titus Mede II: You mean the wedding? My cousin's apparent murder? An               unfortunate misunderstanding, no more. Cold mead, hot tempers...               these things happen.",
"Nobleman: Quite. Yet that recent business with the young officer. Maro, was it?          The son of your commander, plotting your assassination.",
"Titus Mede II: Yes, an unfortunate turn of events, that. But an isolated               incident. And I have been assured that the fault was with the               man's son alone. Truth is, we are in no danger whatsoever.               Killing an Emperor can be useful, but befriending one? Now               that's beneficial -- as I'm sure you'd all agree.",
"Gianna: Here we are. Gods, I'm nervous. We'll go in in just a moment. Please,        I'll serve. You just stand there and...be amazing.",
"Titus Mede II: Aha! Here we are. Honored guests, I present to you -- the               Gourmet! Ah, the Potage le Magnifique. So delicious. My friends,               as Emperor, I of course reserve the right of first taste.",
"Nobleman: (laughs)",
"Noblewoman: (laughs)",
"Titus Mede II: Oh... Oh now marvelous. Just delicious. It is everything I had               hoped it would be. It...I... I think something's...wrong...               I... Ugh...",
"Guard: By the gods! The Gourmet and the chef have poisoned the Emperor! Get       them!",
"Gianna: Help! What? No. No, you don't understand! There's been some kind of        mistake! I... Agghhhhh!",
"Titus Mede II: Oh... Oh now marvelous. Just delicious. It is everything I had               hoped it would be. Please, everyone. Enjoy.",
"Nobleman: The Gourmet. Leave it to Titus to spare no expense.",
"Nobleman 2: I prefer a good roast duck. But your soup will do.",
"Gianna: Maybe when this is all over, you could sign one of your cookbooks for        me?",
"Penitus Oculatus Agent: The missus and I love your strawberry tarts.",
"Penitus Oculatus Agent: Hmmm, the Potage le Magnifique. Smells delicious.",
"Penitus Oculatus Agent: What in blazes!",
"Penitus Oculatus Agent: The Gourmet has killed the Emperor!",
"Maro: That man was, by far, the most insufferable decoy the Emperor has ever      employed. I'm glad he's dead. Ah, but I'm even happier that you killed      him. You, an assassin for the Dark Brotherhood, have just made an attempt      on the Emperor's life. Would have succeeded, had it been the real man.      Surprised? So was I, when a member of your 'Family' came to me with the      plan. We worked out a deal, you see. An exchange. I get you, and the Dark      Brotherhood gets to continue its existence. But you know what? I've      changed my mind. How about this? I kill you, and butcher each and every      one of your miserable little friends? Your Sanctuary's being put to the      sword right now. That's what I think of this 'deal.' You killed my son!      All of you! And now you'll pay the price. Kill him. And make sure there's      nothing left to bury.",
"Agent: Which one was the rat?",
"Agent 2: Dunno. One of these corpses. Does it matter?",
"Agent: Suppose not. But what's taking the others so long? The sooner we get       out of here, the better. Smoke's getting bad. This place'll be raging       soon.",
"Agent 2: Arcturus took some men deeper in, wanted to be sure. We should         maybe...assist them.",
"Agent: You assist all you like. And get roasted for your trouble. I'll guard       the exit.",
"Nazir: If I am to die today, so bet it. But you'll not soon forget the Dark       Brotherhood. Yeargh!",
"Nazir: So you are alive. I was starting to wonder.",
"Dragonborn: The Emperor...it was all a trap. Someone set us up.",
"Nazir: Considering most of us are now dead, I assumed as much. And before you       ask, no -- I don't think it was you. Well, maybe I did, but you saving       my sorry hide just now sort of erased any doubts. So thanks.",
"Dragonborn: We need to get out of here!",
"Nazir: You've got that right. Only a matter of time before we're roasted alive.       Come on!",
"Night Mother: Listener. I am your only salvation. Come. Embrace me.",
"Nazir: Damn it! There's got to be a way out of here.",
"Night Mother: Sleep.",
"Babette: Hurry, Nazir! I'm telling you, he's in there!",
"Nazir: I'm going...as fast...as I can, you stupid she-devil. I don't see       you...helping...",
"Babette: I'm not exactly built for manual labor. Now come on, you've almost         got it.",
"Nazir: One more...pull... Yeaahhhh! There.",
"Babette: Can you get it open?",
"Nazir: I think so. Just hold on a moment.",
"Night Mother: You must speak with Astrid. Here, in the Dark Brotherhood              Sanctuary.",
"Nazir: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. It's all right. You've been through a lot.       Maybe you should just sit down for a bit...",
"Astrid: Alive... You're alive... Thank Sithis...",
"Dragonborn: Astrid...",
"Astrid: Ssshhh... Please. There is much...I have to say. And...not much        time... I'm sorry. So very sorry. The Penitus Oculatus... Maro... He        said that by giving you to them, he would leave the Dark Brotherhood        alone. Forever. By Sithis, I was such a fool. All of this...it's all        my fault. You are the best of us, and I nearly killed you...as I've        killed everyone else...",
"You...sent me to die? Traitor!        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Yes. I set you up. I wanted you dead. I betrayed you, the Night         Mother, and everything I hold dear. And now Maro has betrayed me.",
"You will be judged by Sithis in the Void. I pity you.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         No! Don't pity me. I deserve whatever fate the Dread Lord has in         store. I betrayed you...and now Maro has betrayed me. Fitting...",
"Dragonborn: What are you saying?",
"Astrid: I'm saying you were right. The Night Mother was right. The old ways...        they guided the Dark Brotherhood for centuries. I was a fool to oppose        them. And to prove my...sincerity, I have prayed for a contract. You        lead this Family now. I give you the Blade of Woe, so that you can see        it through. You must kill... Me.",
"Babette: Oh, Astrid...",
"Nazir: Astrid did the right thing, and now it's your turn. End her suffering.",
"Astrid: Uhh...thank you...",
"Nazir: Astrid... By the sands, I still can't wrap my head around it...",
"Babette: If I hadn't heard it with my own ears I wouldn't have believed it.         How could Astrid have done this to us? Strangely, I feel only pity         for her...",
"Night Mother: Astrid is dead. It is as it should be. May she find redemption              in the Void. But while you live, the Dark Brotherhood lives. We              must fulfill our contract. Emperor Titus Mede II must be              eliminated. Speak with Amaund Motierre at the Bannered Mare in              Whiterun. He will know the true Emperor's location. But first,              inform Nazir of your plans. For you are the Listener, and must              bind this Family together.",
"Nazir: By Sithis, what a mess. I guess this is the end.",
"Dragonborn: Not exactly. The Night Mother has spoken to me again.",
"Nazir: What? Well -- what did she say?",
"Dragonborn: I must speak with Amaund Motierre once more.",
"Nazir: Amaund Motierre? But that would mean...",
"Dragonborn: The contract is still on. The true Emperor must be assassinated.",
"Nazir: You mean...there's still a chance? But how? Our plan has gone to ruin,       everyone is dead, the Family...",
"Dragonborn: Our Family lives on, Nazir. You have to trust me.",
"Nazir: Hmph. All right, then. Go. Go, my Listener. Find out what that slimy       bastard Motierre has to say, then send the Emperor to Sithis. Ah, but       when you're done, there's no use returning here, is there? I was       thinking...the Dawnstar Sanctuary. We could make a proper home there.       Listen, when you're finished with this Emperor business, meet Babette       and me there. I'll find some way to move the Night Mother. Don't worry!       Now go! And come back with a barrel full of gold, hmm? Babette, my girl       -- pack your things. We're moving.",
"Babette: I was hoping you'd say that.",
"Amaund: What is it? I said I didn't wish to...be disturbed.              (Remain silent)        We have unfinished business, Motierre.        Sithis is due a soul. Wouldn't you agree?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         By the gods. You...you're alive! But I had heard...your Sanctuary...         Please! You mustn't think I had anything to do with that! I wanted the         Emperor dead! The true Emperor! I still do! It was Maro. He...",
"Dragonborn: The Emperor. The real Emperor. Where is he?",
"Amaund: You mean, after all that's transpired, the Dark Brotherhood will        still...honor the contract? Why, this is astounding news! Wonderful        news! The Emperor is still in Skyrim, but not for long. He's onboard        his ship, the Katariah, moored offshore in the Solitude Inlet. But you        must hurry! If you can get onboard that ship. Kill Titus Mede II, as        contracted...I will reveal the location of the dead drop that holds        your payment.",
"Commander Maro. Where is he?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Ah, yes, I can imagine you'd want to settle that score. Last I heard,         he was at the Solitude docks, conducting the Emperor's departure.",
"What kind of security should I expect?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Surely you're joking? This is the true Emperor, not some half-Septim         lookalike. He'll be surrounded by elite bodyguards, I'm sure. You'll         have your work cut out for you. Still...everyone assumes the Dark         Brotherhood has been completely destroyed. They may be a bit more         lax than usual.",
"This ship, the Katariah. How will I get onboard?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Well, I don't know. It's in the Solitude Inlet -- that's the channel         just north of the docks. I suppose you should go to the docks and...         swim?",
"Please, make haste. The Emperor's ship won't stay moored forever. We        won't get a chance like this again.",
"Maro: By the gods...you! But it can't be. You're dead. You... Yeaaaahhhh!",
"Sailor: *sigh* ...and that's the last one. All right, enough of this. Come on,        let's get something to eat.",
"Sailor 2: Gods, I'll be glad to see the last of Skyrim. Dragons, murder,          rebellion...and we sail right into the middle of it with the Emperor          on board.",
"Sailor: I think we'll all feel better once we're back out at sea. Won't be        long now.",
"Titus Mede II: And, once more, I prove Commander Maro the fool. I told him you               can't stop the Dark Brotherhood. Never could. Come now, don't               be shy. You haven't come this far just to stand there gawking.",
"You were...expecting me?               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                But of course. You and I have a date with destiny. But so it                is with assassins and emperors, hmm?",
"Your rule is at an end! Sithis commands it!               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                Oh, you can save your sinister bravado. I'll not go to my                grave whimpering like an infant. I know why you are here. I                must die. And you must deliver the blow. It is simply the way                it is.",
"But I wonder...would you suffer an old man a few more words               before the deed is done?",
"You will kill me and I have accepted that fate. But regardless               of your path through life, I sense in you a certain...ambition.               So I ask of you a favor. An old man's dying wish. While there               are many who would see me dead, there is one who set the machine               in motion. This person, whomever he or she may be, must be               punished for their treachery. Once you have been rewarded for               my assassination, I want you to kill the very person who ordered               it. Would you do me this kindness?",
"Well? I won't fight you, so we may as well get this over with.",
"Amaund: Aha! You're back!",
"Dragonborn: Titus Mede II lies dead.",
"Amaund: I know! I know! I received the news not moments ago! Ha ha! This is        glorious! My friend, you may not realize it, but you have served the        Empire, indeed all of Tamriel, in ways you cannot possibly imagine.        Ah, but you care little for politics, am I right? You want money! And        money you shall have! Your payment waits for you at a dead drop. It        is inside an urn, in the very chamber where we first met, in Volunruud.        Now please, go. Collect your money, and let us never look upon one        another again. Our business, thank the gods, is concluded.",
"Dragonborn: Actually, Motierre, there is one more thing...",
"Amaund: And what might that be?",
"Just a favor...for an honorable man.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         You assassins and your riddles. It really does get very annoying, you         know. Now if you'll excuse me...",
"Today is the luckiest day of your life.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Ha! Well, I certainly do feel that way. Now, if, um...you'll get         going?",
"Amaund: But...we had a deal...",
"Nazir: Well? What word of the Emperor?",
"Dragonborn: Titus Mede II is dead...by my hand.",
"Nazir: Truly? Could you have brought us more wondrous news? Recent events       nonwithstanding, this is a happy day for us, my friend. Despite your       misfortunes, you stayed true to the Dark Brotherhood. You've saved us       all, and for this you have my eternal thanks. Now, of course I must       ask... Killing the Emperor...how much did Motierre pay for such a thing?",
"Gotcha! It was 20,000 gold.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Ha! I knew it, you rascal! By Sithis, the old man was worth the         trouble. Now, might I offer some advice? You should go to Riften and         find Delvin Mallory. I believe Astrid had you visit him once before?         Sorry, no joke. 5,000 gold. (Lie)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Pfft. You'd think an Emperor would fetch at least twice that. Damn         that motherless cheapskate, Motierre. In any event, here's my advice.         Go to Riften's Ratway, find Delvin Mallory. I believe Astrid had you         visit him once before, no?           Mallory is an expert 'obtainer of goods.' We can use this money to        repair and refit this Sanctuary. Make a true home for us, eh? You do        that and I'll see what I can do about recruiting some new additions        to our Family...",
"Night Mother: It is done. Emperor Titus Mede II lies dead, and the Dark              Brotherhood yet lives. But our work is just beginning. Approach              me, Listener, and hear my words.",
"Cicero: Listener!",
"Nazir: Why am I not surprised to learn Cicero is alive? I still can't stomach       the little clown, but if you've welcomed him here, I won't question it.",
"Babette: So wait, Cicero is alive? And we're all friends again? I swear, I         can hardly keep up...",
"Dragonborn: Can you repair and refit the Dawnstar Sanctuary?",
"Delvin: The Dawnstar Sanctuary? Is that where you lot are holing up in now?        Hmm... Tell you what. It'll cost you -- a lot -- but I can help you        out. What exactly are we talking about here?",
"New banners. (1,000 gold)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Banners, huh? Trying to pretty up the place? All right, you got it.",
"Poisoner's nook. (5,000 gold)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         That'll come in handy, eh? An alchemy station, maybe a little garden         with some choice plants. All right, consider it done.",
"Torture chamber. (5,000 gold)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Oh ho. Now that's the Dark Brotherhood I know and love. This for         business or pleasure? Ah, what's it matter, right? I'll see that it         gets done.",
"Secret entrance (5,000 gold)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Yeah, we can do that. I'm thinking a sewer grate on the outskirts of         Dawnstar. Leads to a tunnel, then inside. You'll be in or out, quick         as a coney.",
"Master bedroom (3,000 gold)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Heh. Chamber fit for a king and all that, right? No problem. Give ya         a big bed, decorate the room real nice, maybe even throw in a few         extra baubles.",
"Nothing. Never mind.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Suit yourself.",
"Delvin: I'm afraid that's it, my friend. I've done all I can. I hope the place        is at least livable, now. Good luck with your, um...murders.",
"Dragonborn: I killed the leader of the Dark Brotherhood.",
"Guard: You did what? By the gods, you're serious. You'd better report this to       Commander Maro right away. He's at the Penitus Oculatus outpost, up in       Dragon Bridge.",
"Dragonborn: A guard sent me. I killed the leader of the Dark Brotherhood.",
"Maro: The leader of the Dark Brotherhood? You mean Astrid? Dead? And this is      no jest? Ha! This is a stroke of good fortune. Long have I watched the      Dark Brotherhood's movements...waiting for the time to strike. That time      is now! My agents have recently acquired the passphrase to their      Sanctuary. It is, 'Silence, my brother.' Every assassin in that hole      must be put down! You, my friend. You've slain their leader. This honor      should be yours. Do this, and you will be rewarded most handsomely!",
"Maro: By all I hold holy... Can it be true? Have you actually done it? This is      a great day, my friend. You have struck a blow against darkness that will      not soon be forgotten! Here, as promised -- a most generous reward! I'll      make sure the Emperor himself hears of all you've accomplished. You've      made Skyrim a better place.",
"Rikke: I'm telling you, Ulfric's planning an attack on Whiterun.",
"Tullius: He'd be insane to try. He doesn't have the men.",
"Rikke: That's not what my scouts report, sir. Every day more join his cause.       Riften, Dawnstar, and Winterhold support him.",
"Tullius: It's not a cause. It's a rebellion.",
"Rikke: Call it whatever you like, General. The man's going to try to take       Whiterun.",
"Tullius: Jarl Balgruuf...",
"Rikke: Jarl Balgruuf refuses the Legion's right to garrison troops in his       city. On the other hand, he also refuses to acknowledge Ulfric's claim.",
"Tullius: Well, if he wants to stand outside the protection of the Empire, fine.         Let Ulfric pillage his city.",
"Rikke: General.",
"Tullius: You people and your damn Jarls.",
"Rikke: Sir? You can't force a Nord to accept help he hasn't asked for.",
"Tullius: If Ulfric's making a move for Whiterun, then we need to be there to         stop him. Draft another letter with the usual platitudes, but this         time share some of your intelligence regarding Ulfric's plans.         Embellish if you have to. We'll let it seem like it's his idea.",
"Rikke: Yes, sir.",
"Tullius: You Nords and your bloody sense of honor.",
"Rikke: Sir.",
"Tullius: Are my men now giving free reign to anyone who wanders into the         castle? Do you have some reason to be here, citizen?",
"One of the prisoners, if I recall correctly.",
"Dragonborn: I was set free. I could've gone anywhere. I came here to fight for            the Empire.",
"Tullius: I suppose that's true. Fine. Why don't you have a chat with Legate         Rikke? I suspect we might have use for someone resourceful like you.         Not many survived Helgen. Besides, I'm sure your being imprisoned was         all a terrible misunderstanding.",
"Rikke: You survived Helgen? General Tullius told me what happened. Not many       made it out alive... I've got a good feeling about you. And I don't       often get good feelings about anything. A warrior knows to trust her       gut...  I'm not going to go through the normal process with you. I've       got a little test lined up. Pass that, and we'll talk about you joining       the Legion.",
"What kind of test?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        The kind that evaluates your usefulness during...duress.",
"Dragonborn: What's at Fort Hraagstad?",
"Rikke: The ancients built many of the fortresses that dot the landscape of       Skyrim. Sadly, most have fallen into disrepair. And nearly all have       been overrun by bandits or other vagabonds. Fort Hraagstad is one of the       few that remains mostly intact. We're going to install a garrison there,       but first, your¹ going to clean out the bandits that have moved in.",
"Yes. This is a test. I don't think you're regular militia material. I        want to see what you're capable of.",
"Consider that fort already yours.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Good. That's what I want to hear. Now go make it happen, soldier.",
"Tullius: Tell me again why I'm wasting men chasing after a fairy tale.",
"Rikke: If Ulfric gets his hands on that crown, it won't be a fairy tale. It'll       be a problem.",
"Tullius: Don't you Nords put any stock in your own traditions? I thought the         Moot chose the king. We're backing Elisif. When the Moot meets,         they'll do the sensible thing.",
"Rikke: Not everyone's agreed to the Moot. You've been here long enough to know       that Nords aren't always sensible. We follow our hearts.",
"Tullius: So what -- Ulfric gets this crown and then suddenly he's High King?",
"Rikke: No, it's not as simple as that, but the Jagged Crown would be a potent       symbol for his cause to rally around. But, if we found it first...",
"Tullius: And we gave it to Elisif?",
"Rikke: In the absence of the Moot, it would further legitimize her claim.",
"Tullius: Perhaps... I'm entrusting you with what resources I can spare. But         I'm warning you, if this turns out to be a waste of time and men...",
"Rikke: It won't be a waste.",
"Tullius: Make sure you take the Auxiliary here. You can send him back when you         get there and find nothing but old bones and cobwebs.",
"Rikke: The Stonefist's¹ no fool. He's found the Crown. But we'll get to it       first.",
"Rikke: Welcome back, soldier. I'm glad you made it in one piece. I'll send men       to garrison the fort right away. You did well. I'm impressed. But before       we go any further, it's time for you to officially join the Legion.       Speak with General Tullius. He'll administer the oath.",
"Tullius: In joining the Legion, you'll be taking an oath binding you to the         service of the Emperor and thus to every citizen of the Empire. Are         you prepared to make that commitment?",
"Actually, I'm not sure. I need to think about it.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I see... Well, the Legion will still be here when you change your          mind. Rikke believes in you. And I'm starting to see why. Consider          this. What greater glory than to serve the Emperor and his citizens          here in Skyrim, in these days of greatest need?",
"Dragonborn: 'Upon my honor I do swear undying loyalty to the Emperor...'",
"Tullius: '...and unwavering obedience to the officers of his great Empire.'",
"Dragonborn: '...and unwavering obedience to the officers of his great Empire.'",
"Tullius: 'May those above judge me, and those below take me, if I fail in my         duty.'",
"Dragonborn: 'May those above judge me, and those below take me, if I fail in            my duty.'",
"Tullius: 'Long live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!'",
"Dragonborn: 'Long live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!'",
"Tullius: Welcome to the Imperial Legion, soldier. Just remember, we take care         of our own. Once you're in the Legion, you're in it for life. Speak         to Beirand, he's normally out by the forge. He'll get you outfitted.         Now, if I'm not mistaken, Legate Rikke has a special assignment for         you.",
"Rikke: Welcome to the Legion, auxiliary. Listen up. Ulfric's right-hand man,       Galmar Stonefist¹, has located what he believes is the final resting       place of the Jagged Crown. We're going to make sure he doesn't get his       hands on it. The rest of my men are already assembling outside       Korvanjund. I'll meet you there as soon as as I finish up here.",
"Dragonborn: What's the Jagged Crown?",
"Rikke: A legendary crown, dating back to King Harald's time, or before. A       powerful relic of a golden age, long since passed. Legend has it that       the crown is made from the bones and teeth of ancient dragons, and is       said to increase the power of the wielder. Whatever the truth, if       Ulfric get's¹ his hands on it, it would be a powerful symbol around       which to rally support for his cause.",
"Dragonborn: How do we know the crown is in Korvanjund?",
"Rikke: Well, to be frank, we don't. Its location was lost with King Borgas,       when the Great Hunt killed him while off on his Alessian campaigns.       Supposedly, his body was brought back to Skyrim and secretly buried       with the crown. Knowledge of that location was lost, in the Wars of       Succession. But my agents report that Galmar is pretty damned convinced       Korvanjund is the tomb of King Borgas. I know Galmar. We fought in many       wars together. He's not a sentimental man taken to fancy. If he believes       the crown is there...he's likely found it.",
"Dragonborn: Why do you fight for the Empire?",
"Rikke: I am a loyal citizen to the Empire. My parents were Legionnaires, and       I've followed in their footsteps. But more importantly, I am a daughter       of Skyrim and wish to see her made whole again.",
"Don't Stormcloaks call themselves 'sons and daughters of Skyrim'?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        I've been a daughter of Skyrim all my life. I love this land and her        people. So do all the Nords that serve the Empire. Ulfric, too, once.        He wasn't always a self-serving ego-maniac. He fought in the Imperial        army in the War against the Dominion. But Ulfric and his 'Stormcloaks'        are deluding themselves. If there's any hope of a long term victory        against the Dominion, it's in the Empire. The rebels are only inflaming        the tension and weakening the Empire by distracting it from its        ultimate aim.",
"Do you consider the Thalmor enemies?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I consider this conversation over.",
"So you have no problem with the treaty that bans the worship of Talos?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        I'm a soldier, not a politician. And my personal beliefs are not yours        to question.",
"Dragonborn: What will it take to end the war?",
"Rikke: I hope Ulfric will come to his senses. But I fear he's in too far to       stop now. Likely only Ulfric's death, or the overthrow of the Jarls       supporting him will end this. Either way, much blood will be spilt.",
"Rikke: What's the situation?",
"Imperial Soldier: The Stormcloaks were already camped around the entrance when                  we got here. They don't know we're here yet, though.",
"Rikke: Well, that's something at least.",
"Rikke: Looks like the damned rebels got here first. No matter, we have the       element of surprise. Prepare to move out.",
"Hold on, I need a minute.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        This isn't a damn summer picnic! Hurry up. We need to hit them before        they know we're here.",
"Listen up, legionnaires. Those Stormcloaks are here for the same reason       we are. Ulfric the Pretender wants that crown, but we're not going to       let him have it. I realize some of you may know men on the other side.       But remember this. They are the enemy now and will not hesitate to end       your lives either. General Tullius is counting on us to bring back the       Jagged Crown, and that's exactly what we're going to do. Let's show       these rebels what real soldiers look like.",
"Rikke: Everybody ready? We charge on my signal. Time to show what you're really       made of. For the Empire!",
"Rikke: You two, stay and guard the entrance. We don't want any Stormcloak       reinforcements taking us by surprise. Everyone else, with me.",
"Rikke: I don't like the look of this. Perfect spot for an ambush. Ten to one       they're just waiting for us on the other side.",
"Imperial Soldier: But there isn't any other way through, Legate.",
"Rikke: Let's not jump to conclusions, soldier. The Legion always finds a way.       I'd rather take a moment and look around than walk blindly into an       ambush. Auxiliary, see if you can find another way through. We'll charge       in to help as soon as we hear fighting. There may be some way to get       through on the level above. Hurry!",
"Stormcloak 1: You hear anything?",
"Stormcloak 2: No, but I know they're out there. No other way they can come. Now              shut it or you'll ruin our ambush.",
"Stormcloak 1: I don't like it. What are they waiting for?",
"Stormcloak 2: Maybe they're so scared of you they ran away.",
"Stormcloak 1: Hardly likely.",
"Stormcloak 2: Just shut up and keep out of sight.",
"Imperial Soldier: What in the nine holds is that?",
"Imperial Soldier: Is this what killed that Stormcloak over there? Can't be. It                  looks like it's been dead for a hundred years.",
"Rikke: Steady now. The Legion has faced down worse than a few dusty old       bonewalkers. We're not leaving here until we get what we came for. Now       let's keep moving.",
"Rikke: And this must be the Hall of Stories.",
"Rikke: One thing at a time¹ soldier. Focus on our primary mission. We're       searching for the crown.",
"Rikke: Looks like we weren't the first ones here, either. Even if these       carvings tell us where the crown is, I'm sure we're going to have to       find a way through this door. See what you can figure out¹ auxiliary,       I'm going to check out these carvings over here. Let me know if you find       something.",
"Rikke: Hmm...what is that? Some kind of stone claw? I wonder what it's used       for?",
"Rikke: Good job! Alright everyone! Keep your guard up. Let's move out!",
"Rikke: Alright legionnaires! Spread out and see what we've got. Auxiliary, do       what you do best. See if you can find some way to get that gate open.       This may sound obvious, but do you see a lever anywhere?",
"Rikke: Alright, let's move, men! We've got more...",
"Rikke: Steady, legionnaires! We've been through worse. Just keep your guard up!",
"Rikke: Follow me! Let's see where this leads.",
"Rikke: The crown should be around here somewhere. Spread out, and keep your       eyes open.",
"Rikke: Well, King... If you don't mind, we'll just take that crown of yours       and be on our way.",
"Rikke: Have it your way. Let's get that crown, men!",
"Rikke: Alright, get that crown off that draugr!",
"Rikke: Take that crown back to Solitude, soldier. We'll stay here and see if we       can find anything ele that could be of use.",
"Dragonborn: Here's the Jagged Crown. Legate Rikke sent me to deliver it to you.",
"Tullius: Excellent work, soldier. I have to admit, I had my doubts it even         existed. Did you run into any trouble?",
"Nothing I couldn't handle.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          That's what I like to hear. I'll get the full report from Legate          Rikke.",
"We lost a lot of good men. I hope it was worth it.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          That's not for you to decide. Soldier¹. I wouldn't have sent you in          the first place if it wasn't going to be worth it.",
"The Stormcloaks were there ahead of us.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Yes. Well, I didn't respond as quickly to the Legate's suggestion as          perhaps I should have. But at least we ended up with the damn crown.",
"Now then... I need someone I can trust to deliver a message of great         import to Jarl Balgruuf of Whiterun. We have it on good authority that         Ulfric has raised enough men to attack the city of Whiterun. The Jarl,         however, refuses the Legion's support. This missive should convince         him. Be aware soldier, these documents contain sensitive intelligence         for the Jarl's eyes only.",
"Dragonborn: I have an important message from General Tullius.",
"Balgruuf: No doubt requesting to garrison his men in my castle. How many times          must I deny him? Well? Out with it.",
"Dragonborn: Ulfric plans to attack Whiterun. The General wants to lend Legion            troops.",
"Balgruuf: • Until that dragon's dealt with, I don't care what Tullius wants.            For now, give the papers to my steward.",
"Dragonborn: I was given strict instructions. For the Jarl's eyes only.",
"Balgruuf: Don't be daft. Proventus is my eyes. Just give me the letter. I          presume once I have it, I can do as I please with it? Good.",
"Balgruuf: Proventus, what do you make of all this? If Ulfric were to attack          Whiterun...",
"Proventus: As in all things, my lord, caution...I urge us to wait and see.",
"Irileth: Prey awaits.",
"Balgruuf: I am of a mind with Irileth. It's time to act.",
"Proventus: You plan to march on Windhelm?",
"Balgruuf: I'm not a fool, Proventus. I mean it's time to challenge Ulfric to          face me as a man, or to declare his intentions.",
"Proventus: He'll do no such thing!",
"Irileth: He was rather straight forward¹ with Torygg.",
"Proventus: Torygg? He simply walked up to the boy and murdered him!",
"Irileth: That 'boy' was High King of Skyrim.",
"Balgruuf: I'm not the High King, but neither am I a boy. If Ulfric wants to          challenge my rule in the old way, let him. Though I suspect he'll          prefer to send his 'Stormcloaks' to do it for him.",
"Irileth: True. He's already proven his personal strength. Now he seeks to prove         his army's.",
"Proventus: Then might I urge you to consider General Tullius's request? I mean,           if you are bent on offending Jarl Ulfric...",
"Irileth: Ulfric is the one who has offended. But, Proventus has a point. Ulfric         has made it clear. In his mind, to refuse his claim is to side with         the Empire.",
"Proventus: And what harm is there in letting a few Legionnaires die in place           of your own men?",
"Balgruuf: It seems cowardly.",
"Irileth: Was it cowardly then to accept the White-Gold Concordat?",
"Balgruuf: This again?! That was different. Was I given a chance to object to          the terms of the treaty? No. The Jarls weren't asked. We were told.          And we had to like it.",
"Proventus: The chests of gold didn't hurt.",
"Balgruuf: Dammit! This isn't about gold!",
"Irileth: It's time to decide.",
"Proventus: Lord, wait. Let us see if Ulfric is serious.",
"Balgruuf: Oh, he's serious. But so am I.",
"Irileth: Finally.",
"Balgruuf: • You there. I have a message for you to deliver to our friend, the            esteemed Jarl of Windhelm. Deliver this axe to Ulfric Stormcloak.",
"An axe?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           How long have you been in Skyrim? Yes. Give the man my axe. If he           returns it to you it means we have business to settle. If he keeps           it, then we are at peace.",
"And you think Ulfric will let me just walk in there, no trouble?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           True, he's a dangerous and blood thirsty¹ man, but he's also a Nord           that honors our traditions. Keep your wits about you and you won't           be harmed. And then get back here. Because if Ulfric isn't bluffing,           I'll need every able body to defend Whiterun.",
"Should I say anything to him?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Men who understand one another need not waste words. There are but           a few simple truths behind one warrior giving another his axe.           Ulfric will know my meaning.",
"Understood.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Good. Good...",
"Balgruuf: Proventus. Bring me my pen. And the good parchment.",
"Proventus: Are we writing a letter, my lord?",
"Balgruuf: Yes, to General Tullius. I need to make a few things clear before I          accept these Legionnaires of his.",
"Ulfric: Yes? Make it quick, I'm a busy man.",
"Dragonborn: i've brought a message from the Jarl of Whiterun.",
"Ulfric: Is that so? I've been wondering when he'd come around. Oh. What's        this? Ahhh... You're quite brave to carry such a message. It's a pity        you've chosen the wrong side... You can return this axe to the man who        sent it. And tell him he should prepare to entertain...visitors. I        expect a great deal of excitement in the city of Whiterun in the near        future...",
"You've killed the High King. Why make war on your own people?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I have shown the people that when our Jarls drink the Empire's milk,         it makes us weak. I must now show them the path that will lead us back         to our strength. There is no progress without sacrifice. No wheat         without threshing the chaff. The Empire and the Jarls who back them         must be swept away. The people demand it. I demand it.",
"You will be stopped.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Oh? True, I may meet my end in a dark alley with a dagger in my back.         But the people have seen the truth, and they will not back down.",
"We'll be seeing you soon.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Sooner than you think.",
"Imperial Guard: Sir! I...I have...",
"Legate Quentin Cipius: Take a moment to breathe, soldier.",
"Imperial Soldier: But...sir...",
"Cipius: Breathe!",
"Balgruuf: The outer walls are strong. If we can hold them there...",
"Cipius: They have catapults.",
"Balgruuf: Damnit. Where did they get catapults? The city walls are already          falling apart as it is.",
"Cipius: My scouts tell me they're loading them with fire.",
"Balgruuf: So, he wants to take my city, walls intact.",
"Cipius: The men will be fighting in flames.",
"Balgruuf: My men are fearless. It's the Imperial milk drinkers I'm worried          about.",
"Cipius: If you prefer I took my men and left...",
"Balgruuf: No. Of course not. Just -- don't let me down¹ Cipius. We'll need to          set up water brigades to combat the flames.",
"Cipius: Already taken care of.",
"Balgruuf: You Imperials are efficient, I'll give you that. How long until they          arrive?",
"Imperial Soldier: Sir.",
"Cipius: Not long. They're hiding in the country side¹.",
"Balgruuf: Damnit. What's he waiting for?",
"Imperial Soldier: Sir!",
"Cipius: What?!",
"Imperial Soldier: Sir, they're on the move. They'll be at the gates at any                  moment!",
"Cipius: Why didn't you say so immediately?!",
"Imperial Soldier: Sir, I tried.",
"Balgruuf: This is it! Time to see what these Stormcloaks are made of.",
"Cipius: The men are already gathering at the gates. Move it¹ soldier. Spread        the word. Go. Go. Go.",
"Balgruuf: Oblivion take them. Every miserable last one of them.",
"Balgruuf: You've returned with my axe. I knew that would be his response. As          soon as you left, I sent word to General Tullius, who's been kind          enough to lend us some of his troops and Legate Cipius here. Let          Ulfric try to make it past our combined forces. I'll turn you back          over to your Legion. Legate Cipius will have use for you. Gods be          with us all.",
"Why side with the Empire?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Mutual advantage! Any fool can see that. For centuries, we have           benefited from the Empire's protection, and prosperous trade with           the south. In exchange, the people of Cyrodiil sleep peacefully,           knowing their northern borders are guarded by the fiercest warriors           in all Tamriel.",
"Cipius: The Stormcloaks are here. In force. Get down to the front line. This is        it. We must hold the city. Now move it!",
"Rikke: This is it men! This is an important day for the Empire and for the       Legion. And for all of Skyrim. This is the day we send a message to       Ulfric Stormcloak and the rebel Jarls who support him. But make no       mistake. What we do here today, we do for Skyrim and her people. By       cutting out the disease of this rebellion, we will make this country       whole again! Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire! For the       Legion!",
"Whiterun Guard: Rrraaaaaggghhhh!",
"Whiterun Guard: Rrraaaaa!",
"Hadvar: You made it? I was sure I'd find you face down in the dirt.",
"Balgruuf: Revel in your victory here today, even as the gods revel in your          honor! They already sing of your valor and skill! The halls of          Sovngarde are no doubt ringing with your praises! In defeating those          Stormcloak traitors, you have proven the hollowness of their cause          and the fullness of your hearts. The citizens of Whiterun are forever          in your debt! But Ulfric will not stop here. No, he will continue to          strike out against any true Nord who remains faithful to the Empire.          He will continue to sow discord and chaos wherever he can. And so,          we must each one of us, continue to fight this insurrection, lest our          fallen brothers have died for naught! Lest our honor be lessened          should we allow these bloodthirsty beasts to prowl our lands! Carry          on men, my gratitude and blessings go with you! For Whiterun! For          the Empire!",
"Balgruuf: Thank you for your role in all of this. It would be my honor should          you decide to make Whiterun your home. Speak with Proventus. He'll          make the necessary arrangements.",
"Tullius: By defeating Ulfric at Whiterun we have solidified the allegiance of         the Jarl. Perhaps the Stormcloaks will soon lose heart for this little         rebellion of theirs once and for all. I'm promoting you to Quaestor.         Take this blade, a symbol of your new station and responsibility. I'll         keep an eye on your progress. The Empire rewards excellence, and so do         I.",
"Dragonborn: What are my new orders, sir?",
"Tullius: You'd be wasted as a regular soldier. I have special plans for you.         You'll be of greater use to me with greater flexibility. Make your way         to our hidden military camp in the Pale. Rikke will have important         tasks for you, and will need you when we reclaim the capital.",
"What exactly will I be doing in the field?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          You'll be doing whatever Rikke tells you to do. And, I expect you to          find creative ways to disrupt the Stormcloaks along the way.",
"Yes sir.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          • For the Emperor!          • Gods be with you.",
"Dragonborn: Reporting for duty.",
"Rikke: I need you to deliver some false orders to the Stormcloak commander in       Dawnstar. But first we need to get our hands on some rebel orders to       make the forgeries. The Nightgate and Candlehearth Inns are frequent       stops for Stormcloak runners. See if you can't 'convince' one of those       innkeepers to help you. One way or another, get me those documents. But       don't do anything rash if you go to Windhelm. Well, soldier? Can you do       this?",
"Consider it done.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        • Good luck out there.        • Good. Make it happen, soldier.",
"Hadring: Ah, hello there, traveler. Come to the Nightgate for food or lodging?",
"Dragonborn: Seen any Stormcloak couriers lately?",

I need you to find evidence of her corrupt activities, and       use it to gain a measure of her 'cooperation.' This will require stealth       and discretion. The Jarl's guards won't take kindly to anyone rummaging       through her Steward's private quarters.",

The Jarl benefits          from my more creative arrangements as well, though it'd be impossible          for her to admit that. Laila is a simple and traditional woman.

"Go on. I'm listening.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Oh, no. I'm no fool. You'll learn what you need to know once we've           come to an agreement.",

"Rikke: Something to report?",
"Dragonborn: Anuriel says there's a shipment of coin traveling to Windhelm...",

"Tullius: There's not much up there, but if we can regain Winterhold, our         proximity to Windhelm should keep Ulfric wary and wasting troops         garrisoned at home. By holding onto Falkreath, we control access to         the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. Ulfric will try for it soon. We'll         be there to stop him.",

I need you to sneak in there, and        free our men, killing anyone inside as you go. Once you've rescued the        prisoners, head out to the courtyard.

Many of         you will be staying in Windhelm to aid the Jarl in restoring order         and stamping out any embers of rebellion that may still smolder here.

"Rikke: It wasn't so bad.",
"Tullius: I hope we haven't just created a martyr.",
"Rikke: There's bound to be resistance. There are many Stormcloak camps tucked       away in the hills. They'll no doubt strike whenever and wherever they       can. But without Ulfric to inflame their passions, they'll settle down       and return to their homes eventually.",
"Tullius: I pray you're right, Legate. In the meantime, we'll continue to root         them out and put them to the sword.",
"Tullius: We couldn't have done this without you. The Empire glories in your         accomplishments... Come, Rikke. There's still much to be done.",
"Dragonborn: Now that Ulfric is dead, will there be peace?",
"Tullius: The fiercest of the remaining rebels will continue to harass us, but         by in¹ large, the people here desire peace. What I'm not so sure about         is the peace we've made with the Thalmor. But we'll kee that between         the two of us, alright?",
"Dragonborn: Will you return to Cyrodiil now?",
"Tullius: No, I suspect Skyrim to be my home for many years. Can't say I'll ever         get used to the damn cold, or understand these Nords...but, I've come         to respect them. The harshness of Skyrim has a way of carving a man         down to his true self.",
"Dragonborn: Is there anything further I can do for the Legion?",
"Tullius: Ulfric is dead and his army destroyed. There's not much more I could         ask of you. The gods, however, I suspect, may have plans for you         elsewhere. That said, Stormcloak true believers are still operating         out of hidden military camps in the hills. If you encounter any on         you¹ travels, kill them. With luck, they'll soon lose heart and return         to their homes and families. If not, we'll be forced to put them all         to the sword.",
"Dragonborn: Now that Ulfric is dead, will there be peace?",
"Rikke: There are those who still call themselves Stormcloaks, who continue to       fight us, and bring misery to the people...but they are few in number.       The ordinary citizen will be happy to get back to life as normal, to       have their families return home. And they should enjoy it while they       can...I suspect all of Tamriel will againb e called to arms in the not       too distant future.",
"Dragonborn: What's next for the accomplished Legate Rikke?",
"Rikke: The General's put me in charge of assisting the new governments. I may       understand things here in Skyrim better than the General, but I'm a       soldier at heart, not a politician. But I'll do my best. This is the       land of my birth, the land that shaped me. I'm proud to have any part       in making it strong again.",
"Dragonborn: Is there anything further I can do for the Legion?",
"Rikke: The Legion's work is far from finished, but you are free to roam. I       suspect you'll be of greater good to Skyrim out there, in the world.       If while you're out there, you stumble into any Stormcloak military       camps, I expect you to destroy them. I've reports they are hiding in the       hills.",
"Galmar: If he's not with us, he's against us.",
"Ulfric: He knows that. They all know that.",
"Galmar: How long are you going to wait?",
"Ulfric: You think I need to send Balgruuf a stronger message.",
"Galmar: If by message you mean shoving a sword through his gullet.",
"Ulfric: Taking his city and leaving him in disgrace would make a more powerful        statement, don't you think?",
"Galmar: So we're ready to start this war in earnest then?",
"Ulfric: Soon.",
"Galmar: I still say you should take them all out like you did Deadking Torygg.",
"Ulfric: Torygg was merely a message to the other Jarls. Whoever we replace them        with will need the support of our armies.",
"Galmar: We're ready when you are.",
"Ulfric: Things hinge on Whiterun. If we can take the city without bloodshed¹        all the better. But if not...",
"Galmar: The people are behind you.",
"Ulfric: Many I fear still need convincing.",
"Galmar: Then let them die with their false kings.",
"Ulfric: We've been soldiers a long time. We know the price of freedom. The        people are still weighing things in their hearts.",
"Galmar: What's left of Skyrim to wager?",
"Ulfric: They have families to think of.",
"Galmar: How many of their sons and daughters follow your banner? We are their        families.",
"Ulfric: Well put, friend. Tell me, Galmar, why do you fight for me?",
"Galmar: I'd follow you into the depths of Oblivion, you know that.",
"Ulfric: Yes, but why do you fight? If not for me, what then?",
"Galmar: I'll die before elves dictate the fates of men. Are we not one in this?",
"Ulfric: I fight for the men I've held in my arms, dying on foreign soil. I        fight for their wives and children, who's¹ names I heard whispered in        their last breaths. I fight for we few who did come home, only to find        our country full of strangers wearing familiar faces. I fight for my        people impoverished to pay the debts of an Empire too weak to rule        them, yet brands them criminals for wanting to rule themselves! I fight        so that all the fighting I've already done hasn't been for nothing. I        fight...because I must.",
"Galmar: Your words give voice to what we all feel, Ulfric. And that's why you        will be High King. But the day words are enough, will be the day        soldiers like us are no longer needed.",
"Ulfric: I would gladly retire from the world were such a day to dawn.",
"Galmar: Aye. But in the meantime, we have a war to plan.",
"Ulfric: Only the foolish or the courageous approach the Jarl without summons...        Do I know you?",
"Destined for the chopping block if I'm not mistaken.",
"Ulfric: I remember you... You were at Helgen with us! Come to join the war?        Speak with Galmar. He handles the new recruits.",

"That's not why I'm here.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I'm sorry to hear that. If you change your mind, speak with Galmar.         What does bring you to me?",
"Galmar: Hmm. Helgen, eh? Ulfric told us quite the story. If you made it through        that, you're likely worth something to me. But first, tell me. Why's a        foreigner want to fight or Skyrim?",
"Skyrim is my home.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Fair enough. But are you willing to die for your home?",
"Dragonborn: That's why I'm here. I want to join.",
"Galmar: All right. But before I can put you to use, I need to know how much        you can take. I have a little test for you.",
"What kind of test?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         The kind men use to measure themselves.",
"Dragonborn: What's at Serpentstone Island?",
"Galmar: It's where men have tested their mettle for ages. There's a strange        rock formation there, built by the ancients. Something about that        place attracts the Ice Wraiths. You kill an Ice Wraith out there, and        I'll have the proof I need about you.",
"Does every recruit have to do this?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Only the ones I'm not sure about. This will prove your abilities, but         more importantly, it will prove your commitment.",
"At the end of the day, every warrior is alone. Before you can stand         next to your shield brother, you need to be able to stand on your own.",
"Ulfric: Tell me again why we're wasting time and resources chasing a legend. We        don't even know it exists!",
"Galmar: The Jarls are upset. They don't all support you.",
"Ulfric: Damn the Jarls.",
"Galmar: They demand the Moot.",
"Ulfric: And damn the Moot! We should risk letting those milkdrinkers put        Torygg's woman on the throne? She'll hand Skyrim over to the elves on        a silver plate.",
"Galmar: All the more reason then. The crown would legitimize your claim.",
"Ulfric: A crown doesn't make a king.",
"Galmar: No, but this one...",
"Ulfric: If it even exists.",
"Galmar: It exists. And it'll be the symbol of the righteousness of our cause.        Think about it. The Jagged Crown! It heralds back to a time before        jarls and moots. Back to a time when a king was a king because his        enemies fell before him, and his people rose because they loved him.        Skyrim needs that king. You will be that king, Ulfric. You must be.",
"Ulfric: You're certain you've found it?",
"Galmar: When have I ever been false with you?",
"Ulfric: Fine. I'll send the Unblooded here with you. Fancy a crawl through a        moldering dungeon to see if you can't stir up Galmar's Jagged Crown?",
"Galmar: It'll be there. You'll see.",
"Galmar: You're alive. I owe Ulfric a drink. I have to admit, I didn't think        we'd be seeing you again. I misjudged you. You're definitely Stormcloak        material. It's time we made this official. You ready to take the Oath?",
"Are you saying you sent me out there to die?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Not at all. That was as much a test of your abilities as it was your         resolve. I wasn't sure your heart was in it. But you've proven me         wrong. And I respect that. Now, if were¹ done being sentimental, it's         time for you to take the Oath.",
"Oath?        ¯¯¯¯¯         Before you're one of us, you must swear fealty to Jarl Ulfric         Stormcloak, future High King of Skyrim. You must also pledge         unswerving loyalty to your fellow Stormcloaks, to Skyrim and to her         people.",
"Isn't it enough that I want to fight Imperials?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         You can stick a sword through an Imperial any day you want. But that         doesn't make you a Stormcloak. We're not just fighting Imperials.         We're fighting to restore Skyrim to her glory and give her the king         she deserves.",
"Galmar: By swearing this oath, you become one of us. A hero of the people. A        true son of Skyrim. A Stormcloak. Repeat after me. 'I do swear my        blood and honor to the service of Ulfric Stormcloak...'",
"Dragonborn: 'I do swear my blood and honor to the service of Ulfric            Stormcloak...'",
"Galmar: '...Jarl of Windhelm and true High King of Skyrim.'",
"Dragonborn: '...Jarl of Windhelm and true High King of Skyrim.'",
"Galmar: 'As Talos is my witness, may this oath bind me to death and beyond...'",
"Dragonborn: 'As Talos is my witness, may this oath bind me to death and            beyond...'",
"Galmar: '...even to my lord as to my fellow brothers and sisters in arms.'",
"Dragonborn: '...even to my lord as to my fellow brothers and sisters in arms.'",
"Galmar: 'All hail the Stormcloaks, the true sons and daughters of Skyrim!'",
"Dragonborn: 'All hail the Stormcloaks, the true sons and daughters of Skyrim!'",
"Galmar: Now you're one of us. Which means you get to tag along on a little trip        with me. Oh, and here. You're a Stormcloak now, you ought to look the        part.",
"Dragonborn: What's the mission?",
"Galmar: I have found the final resting place of the Jagged Crown. Can you        believe it? Well, I'm almost certain. We're headed to Korvanjund. But,        if old King Borgas is indeed buried there, we're bound to run into        trouble of some kind. Your fellow Stormcloaks are already assembling        outside the tomb. I'll meet you there as soon as I'm finished up here.        Don't wait around for me. I bet I'll beat you to Korvanjund even though        you start first.",
"Dragonborn: What's the Jagged Crown?",
"Galmar: Have you not heard that ancient verse? 'Maw unleashing razor snow, Of        dragons from the blue brought down, Births the walking winter's woe,        The High King in his Jagged Crown.' Going way back to King Harald's        time or even before, the High King always wore the Jagged Crown. It        was the symbol of his might and power. The crown is made from the        bones and teeth of ancient dragons, and it is said to contain a portion        of the power of every king who has worn it. True or not, who would dare        deny Ulfric's claim, when the legendary Jagged Crown sits upon his        brow?",
"Dragonborn: How do you know the crown is in Korvanjund?",
"Galmar: It's true, the location of the crown was lost with King Borgas. After        the Great Hunt killed him, while he was off on his damned Alessian        campaigns. But legend holds, his body was secretly returned to Skyrim        and buried with the crown. Its exact whereabouts lost in the following        Wars of Succession. Through sources that shall remain nameless, I've        tracked down what I believe to be the final resting place of King        Borgas -- Korvanjund. If the crown exists, it will be there.",
"Dragonborn: You anticipate danger?",
"Galmar: Aye. The Great Hunt killed old King Borgas. Gods only know with what        profane arts those elves cursed his remains. Curses nonwithstanding,        the tombs of kings are always full of traps to ward off grave robbers,        are they not? But nothing a band of Stormcloaks can't handle, I assure        you.",
"Ralof: Ha, I knew you'd join up! Great news. We'll take back Skyrim together,       eh? I'm glad I'll have you beside me in there. This place chills my       blood, and I don't care who knows it.",
"Dragonborn: What are you talking about?",
"Ralof: These old ruins... My father always told me to stay away from them. Good       advice, I'd say. But never mind all that. We've got a job to do, and       nothing's going to stand in our way.",
"Galmar: Hail, Ilfhild.",
"Stormcloak Soldier: Hail, Galmar.",
"Galmar: What's the situation?",
"Galmar: Imperials? Well, if they're keeping themselves comfortable, let's slip        in and send them to their graves that way.",
"Galmar: What's the Legion doing here? Damn Imperial spies... Well, should be        fun for us, at least. They don't seem to know we're here yet. Ready to        spill some Imperial blood for Skyrim?",
"Hold on. I need a minute.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Even the Imperials might eventually decide to patrol their perimeter.         Get yourself ready!",
"Listen up. Those Imperials aren't here by coincidence. Their spies        must have found out we know about the Crown, and they don't want us        to have it. But they won't stand in our way. I know some of you are        ex-legion¹ and may know men on the other side. But remember this. They        are the enemy now and they will not hesitate to kill you. Keep your        wits about you and watch your shield brother's back. Ulfric Stormcloak        is counting on us to bring him back that crown, and that's exactly what        we are going to do. Follow me. Quickly and quietly now. I want their        guts on the ground before they even know we're here.",
"Galmar: Pick a man and put him down. We attack on my signal. Time to show what        you're really made of. For Skyrim!",
"Galmar: Gretta, Engar, stay and guard the entrance. We don't want any Imperial        reinforcements taking us by surprise. The rest of you lot are with me.",
"Galmar: I don't like the look of this. Perfect spot for an ambush. Ten to one        they're just waiting for us on the other side.",
"Stormcloak Soldier: But there isn't any other way through.",
"Galmar: You sure about that? Then please, be my guest and go strolling on in        there. We'll stay here and watch your back... Not so sure? Oh, then        perhaps we should take a moment to look around a little, eh? You there,        Unblooded, see if you can find another way through. We'll charge in to        help as soon as we hear fighting. There may be some way to get through        on the level above. Hurry!",
"Imperial 1: You hear anything?",
"Imperial 2: No, but I know they're out there. No other way they can come. Now            shut up or you'll blow our ambush.",
"Imperial 1: I don't like it. What are they waiting for?",
"Imperial 2: Maybe they're so scared of you they ran away.",
"Imperial 1: Hardly likely.",
"Imperial 2: Just shut up and keep out of sight.",
"Imperial Soldier: It must be the Stormcloaks! Attack!",
"Galmar: Careful, boys. There's bound to be more up ahead.",
"Stormcloak 1: What in the nine holds is that?",
"Stormcloak 2: Draugr. Ain't you ever seen one before?",
"Stormcloak 1: No. And I'm not sure I'm better off for it now neither.",
"Galmar: Steady. A few dusty bonewalkers aren't going to stop us anymore than        the Imperials could. We're not leaving until we get what we came for.        Now let's keep moving.",
"Galmar: Ah! The Hall of Stories...we must be getting close now.",
"Stormcloak 1: Oh...I've heard of this. They say these walls show the history of              the ancients who built this place.",
"Stormcloak 2: Too bad we can't read these carvings. Who knows what secrets              we'd uncover?",
"Galmar: One thing at a time. We're here for the Crown. Any of these carvings        show a crown?",
"Galmar: Hmm, looks like this is as far as the Imperials got. Even if one of        these pictures tells us where the Crown is, I'm betting we're going to        have to find a way through that door. See what you can figure out,        Unblooded. I'm going to check out these carvings over here. Let me know        if you find something.",
"Galmar: Hmm...that looks like some kind of claw from a statue. I wonder what        it's used for.",
"Galmar: Good job! Alright everyone! Keep your guard up. No telling what we'll        find down here.",
"Galmar: Come on, boys. Let's spread out and see what we've got. Unblooded, do        what you do best. See if you can find some way to get that gate open.",
"Galmar: That's done it! Alright, boys, let's get moving. We've got more...",
"Stormcloak: Look out! Draugr!",
"Galmar: Steady now! They may be uglier than Imperials but they'll go down just        the same.",
"Galmar: Let's hope that's the last of them. Come on, let's see what's down        this way.",
"Galmar: The crown must be around here somewhere. Spread out, and keep your eyes        open.",
"Ralof: Hey, I found a crown over here on this corpse. Is this the one we're       looking for?",
"Galmar: Ralof...get away from there, fool!",
"Galmar: Get to Windhelm with the crown as quick as you can. Tell Ulfric he owes        me a drink. We'll stick around here for a while and see if we can find        anything else useful.",
"Dragonborn: Here's the Jagged Crown. I believe you owe Galmar a drink?",
"Ulfric: Damn him -- the old bear was right! Did you run into any trouble?",
"Nothing I couldn't handle.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         That's the spirit. I'll get all the details from Galmar when he gets         back.",
"We lost a lot of good men. I hope it was worth it.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         The blood of our fallen heroes will make Skyrim free, never doubt it.         Also, never doubt me or Galmar.",
"The Imperials were there ahead of us.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Damn it. What were they doing there? Imperial spies are everywhere.         Never forget that... I trust you gave them a thrashing?",
"Now then... I'm glad you're here. I have a message I need delivered to        the Jarl of Whiterun. Deliver this axe to Balgruuf the Greater.",
"An axe?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Yes. An axe. How long have you been in Skyrim.¹ Give the man my axe.         If he keeps it, I will bide my time. If he returns it to you, it means         war.",
"Should I say anything to him?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Men who understand each other often have no need for words. There are         but a few simple truths behind one warrior giving another his axe.         Balgruuf will know my meaning.",
"Dragonborn: Understood.",
"Ulfric: Keep your wits about you. The Jarl of Whiterun is known for his temper.",
"Dragonborn: Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak asked me to deliver this axe to you.",
"Balgruuf: Did he now? The man is persistent, I'll give him that.",
"Proventus: As in all things, Lord, caution...I urge us to wait and see.",
"Irileth: Prey waits.",
"Balgruuf: I'm of a mind with Irileth. It's time to act.",
"Proventus: You plan to march on Windhelm?",
"Balgruuf: I'm not a fool, Proventus. I mean it's time to challenge Ulfric to          face me as a man, or march his Stormcloaks up to the gates.",
"Proventus: He'll do no such thing! A dagger in the back is all you could           expect!",
"Irileth: He was rather straight forward¹ with Torygg.",
"Proventus: Torygg? He simply walked up to the boy and murdered him!",
"Irileth: That 'boy' was the High King of Skyrim.",
"Balgruuf: I'm not the High King, but neither am I a boy. If Ulfric wants to          challenge my rule in the old way, let him. Though I suspect he'll          prefer to send his 'Stormcloaks' to do it for him.",
"Irileth: True. He's already proven his personal strength. Now he seeks to prove         his army's.",
"Proventus: Then might I urge you to consider General Tullius's request? I mean,           if you are bent on offending Jarl Ulfric...",
"Irileth: Ulfric is the one who has offended. But, Proventus has a point. Ulfric         has made it clear. In his mind, to refuse his claim is to side with         the Empire.",
"Proventus: And what harm is there in letting a few Legionnaires die in place           of your own men?",
"Balgruuf: It seems cowardly.",
"Irileth: Was it cowardly then to accept the White-Gold Concordat?",
"Balgruuf: This again?! That was different. Was I given a chance to object to          the terms of the treaty? No. The Jarls weren't asked. We were told.          And we had to like it.",
"Proventus: The chests of gold didn't hurt.",
"Balgruuf: Dammit! This isn't about gold!",
"Irileth: It's time to decide.",
"Proventus: Lord, wait. Let us see if Ulfric is serious.",
"Balgruuf: Oh, he's serious. But so am I.",
"Irileth: Finally.",
"Balgruuf: So about this axe... You can return this axe to our friend. The          esteemed Jarl of Windhelm has my answer. Make sure he gets it.          Proventus. Bring me my pen. And the good parchment.",
"Proventus: Are we writing a letter, Lord?",
"Balgruuf: Yes, to General Tullius. I need to make a few things clear before I          accept these Legionnaires of his.",
"Dragonborn: The Jarl of Whiterun returns your axe.",
"Ulfric: Then I was wrong about him. You were right¹ Galmar.",
"Galmar: Again?",
"Ulfric: I'm in no mood to joke.",
"Galmar: Give the word, my lord, and Whiterun is yours.",
"Ulfric: Whiterun is only a means to an end.",
"Galmar: I've toured our camps. We're ready, Ulfric... Whenever you are.",
"Ulfric: Is a man ever ready to give the orders that will mean the deaths of        many.¹",
"Galmar: No. But neither is every man able to give that order when he must. But        you are that man, Ulfric. You've been that man before, and you'll be        him again. And these men and women -- they call themselves Stormcloaks        because they believe in you... They are the meanest, toughest sons of        bitches Skyrim has to offer. And they want this. They want this as much        as you do. Perhaps they want it more.",
"Ulfric: You're certain we're ready? Whiterun's army will no doubt be bolstered        by Legionnaires. And those walls around Whiterun are old, but they        still stand.",
"Galmar: We're ready. And I might be old myself, but I'll kick those damn walls        down with my bare feet! -- if you would only ask me to do it!",
"Ulfric: And I'm sure you could do it, too. Alright. This is it.",
"Galmar: Yes!",
"Ulfric: Send the word. 'A new day is dawning and the sun rises over Whiterun.'",
"Galmar: Aye, and the sons of Skyrim will greet that dawn teeth and swords        flashing.",
"Ulfric: So it begins. Make haste to our camp in Whiterun. I want you on the        front lines. I have a feeling about you. Your place is on that        battlefield. I need you there.",
"Yes, sir!        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Fight well, or die well.",
"Many will die by my hand.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Then I commit them to whatever gods they still believe in.",
"Talos be with you!",
"Galmar: We're taking the city. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack.        Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.",
"Galmar: This is it, men!",
"Ralof: So, do you get that weird taste in your mouth before battle, too? What       is that?",
"Irileth: Halt in the name of the Jarl, Balgruuf the Greater!",
"Balgruuf: I'll be damned if I let this rabble take my city without raising my          own sword.",
"Irileth: Stay back, lord!",
"Balgruuf: Enough! That's enough. I surrender...I surrender. Peace! Everyone          stand down. That's an order. Stand down!",
"Vignar Gray-Mane: Balgruuf!",
"Balgruuf: Vignar Gray-Mane! Your family was noticeably absent from the walls...          Now I know why. Wouldn't a dagger in the back have sufficed?",
"Vignar: You think this is personal? The Empire has no place in Skyrim... Not        any more. And you? You have no place in Whiterun anymore.",
"Balgruuf: A convenient position to hold now. But mark my words, old man, in          the days to come, Ulfric will spread his rebellion thin. And what          then? We need the Empire, as much as it needs us. We Nords are the          Empire! Our blood built it. Our blood sustains it! You of all people          should know that.",
"Vignar: If this was my Empire, I'd be able to worship whoever I damned well        pleased. You wish to see an Empire without Talos? Without its soul? We        should be fighting those witch-elves, not bending knee to them. The        Emperor is nothing more than a puppet of the Thalmor. Skyrim needs a        High King who will fight for her, and Whiterun needs a Jarl who will        do the same.",
"Balgruuf: Tell me, Vignar. Was all this worth it? How many of those corpses          lining our streets wear the faces of men who once called you friend?          What about their families?",
"Galmar: Enough! Both of you! There is a burning city out there that needs a        government.",
"Vignar: He's right. Galmar, come, let us restore order.",
"Balgruuf: This isn't over. You hear me you old fool! This isn't over!",
"Balgruuf: And you. A Stormcloak? I'd thought better of you. You'll all come to          regret this day.",
"Galmar: Get over to Windhelm. Tell Ulfric of our victory here.",
"Ralof: I'm pretty sure I killed more than you. I was counting.",
"Ulfric: We've driven the Imperials out of Whiterun. This is good. Very good.        We now control the center. It's a powerful position. One I aim to keep.        We'll call you Ice-Veins now, for the thick blood of our land has        seeped into your heart. Here, take this. It's an Imperial officer's        sword. A fitting weapon to use against our enemy.",
"Dragonborn: What's our next move against the Empire?",
"Ulfric: I suspect you'll be of greater use to us with greater freedom, so        you're free to engage the Imperials as you see fit. But I also want you        to find our hidden camp in Falkreath. Galmar will have special tasks        for you, and will need you when we liberate the capital.",
"What exactly will I be doing out there?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         You'll be doing whatever Galmar tells you to do, and causing as much         mayhem as possible for the Empire and any Jarl who supports them.",
"Understood.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • Talos guide you.         • Go with the gods.",
"Dragonborn: Reporting in.",
"Galmar: You're going to Fort Neugrad. They have some of our boys locked up        there. But with a little luck, we can turn that to our advantage. I've        sent some men to scout the area. Meet them, see if you can't find a way        to slip in, free our men, and take over the fort. They'll never suspect        an attack from the inside. This won't be easy. But that's why I'm        sending you. You got the grit to get this done?",
"Nothing I can't handle.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • We all have faith in you.         • Good. You've got real fire in you. I like that... Talos guide you.",
"Ralof: Well, well. Look who it is! How have you been?",
"Only a beast kills without feeling.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I suppose you're right...they say it gets easier... I'm not sure if          that's a good thing...",
"If you hadn't killed them, they would have killed you.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          That's what I keep telling myself.",
"But, never mind all that. We've got a job to do.",
"So what's the plan? / What's the plan?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Straight to business with you, huh? Well, it just so happens I have        the perfect mission for you. We found a cave under the lake. With        luck, it'll lead into the prison. I need you to sneak in there, free        our men, killing anyone inside as you go. Once you've rescued the        prisoners, head out to the courtyard. We'll stand guard out here and        rush in as soon as we hear fighting. Should be fun.",
"Talos preserve you.",
"Stormcloak: The guard has the key.",
"Ralof: Great work! Get back and report our success. I'll stay here and clean       up the mess. Glad you were here. Couldn't have done it without you!",
"Ulfric: I'm proud we liberated Falkreath from the Empire. In many ways it's the        heart and soul of Skyrim. Not to mention its rather strategic position.        Some brothers have taken to calling you Bone-Breaker, evidence of your        ferocity and determination. A fitting name. So we shall all call you        thus. The war demands so much from us, and we give all we have to it        and the people...but I've kept a little something to offer you in        appreciation. Please take this on behalf of all the brothers and        sisters. And I need capable and loyal warriors close at hand. So I'd        like to offer you a home in Windhelm. Speak with my steward who'll make        the arrangements.",
"Dragonborn: What's our next move against the Empire?",
"Ulfric: Get over to our camp in the Reach. They need every able body they can        muster.",
"What exactly will I be doing out there?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         You'll be doing whatever Galmar tells you to do, and causing as much         mayhem as possible for the Empire and any Jarl who supports them.",
"Understood.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • Talos guide you.         • For Skyrim!",
"Dragonborn: Reporting in.",
"Galmar: Get over to Markarth. Rumor has it the Jarl's steward, Raerek, is a        faithful Talos worshipper, if not a true son of Skyrim -- he still        supports the Empire, after all. But, if confronted with proof of his        belief, you might be able to 'persuade' him to aid our cause,        indirectly of course. Wouldn't want to sully his reputation, would we?        You'll need to be careful with this one. The Jarl's men won't look        kindly on you rummaging through the steward's quarters.",
"Dragonborn: Recognize this? (Show him Raerek's Inscribed Amulet of Talos)",
"Raerek: Not here. Come with me. Stay close and the guards will leave you alone.",
"Raerek: I suppose you're here to extort something from me? Is that it? Well,        what is it you want?",
"If you believe in Talos, why don't you join our cause?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         So. You're one of Ulfric's spies... I can't deny the man is right         about a few things... But I've seen first hand what Ulfric is capable         of, given the chance. Suffice it to say, he is no friend of Markarth,         and no friend of mine. My first and only loyalties are to my nephew,         and to this city.",
"What if this were made public?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         The Thalmor would need to make an example of me...I'd be thrown into         prison, but our family's honor would be stained for generations. I'm         the Jarl's uncle. He, his father, and I, swore oaths to the Empire to         abandon Talos, as conditions of our return to the city.",
"Dragonborn: Perhaps we could come to some kind of agreement?",
"Raerek: What if I told you about a large shipment of silver and weapons?",
"Go on. I'm listening.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Oh, no. I won't tell you anything more until we have an agreement.",
"And what about something for me, right now? (Persuade)         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Well I...I suppose I'm not left much choice in the matter, am I? Very          well. I trust a hefty purse of septims will suffice?",
"How much are we talking about?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Enough to make a significant difference in the war.",
"All right, it's a deal. Where can I find this shipment?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         They're taking it by wagon to Solitude. If you hurry, you'll catch         them before they get far. It'll be a fairly slow moving¹ caravan. The         shipment is quite heavy, and guarded by many men.",
"Now, let's pretend we never had this discussion.",
"Dragonborn: Raerek says there's a shipment of coin traveling to Solitude...",
"Galmar: Good job. I knew you'd come back with something for me. It just so        happens, I've got some scouts along the road. Meet up with them, and        together see if you can't overpower the caravan.",
"Ralof: Hey there! I was wondering when I'd run into you out here. The Reach is       a beautiful but dangerous place, eh? One false step and you'll fall to       your death, that is if those Forsworn don't get you first. Have you       seen those Briarheart men? That's some evil magic right there. What       brings you? You have the look of purpose in your eyes.",
"Dragonborn: There's an enemy wagon loaded with coin and weapons. We need to            capture it.",
"Ralof: Really? It just so happens we've been tracking a wagon! For about a day       now. So that's what's in there? Coins and weapons? How do you know       that?",
"It doesn't matter.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Oh, fine. Keep your secrets. I see how it is. That wagon recently had        a little accident. They're stranded now, just up the road.               We're outnumbered, but I have a plan. You got here just in time.",
"Dragonborn: What's the plan?",
"Ralof: First, we're going to take out their sentry, then we'll situate       ourselves overlooking the camp. Next, you'll infiltrate their position       and get their attention while we hit them with a barrage of arrows. With       a bit of luck, we'll catch them completely off guard and even the odds a       little.",
"Let's wait a little longer.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Let me know when you're ready.",
"Ready. Let's go.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Good.",
"Ralof: There's a sentry patrolling the hill. We'll go in quiet and drop him       with a combined arrow barrage. Keep low, fire on my word. Fire!",
"Ralof: All right. You infiltrate their camp, we'll cover you from the ridge.       Good luck!",
"Ralof: We make quite a team, eh? I'll stay here and guard the shipment. You       get back to camp with news. Have them send some men -- and a new wagon.       This one isn't going anywhere.",
"Galmar: Well done! I'll send men with a wagon to collect our prize. We'll put        the weapons to use here, and I'll send the coin back to Windhelm.",
"Galmar: You're going to Fort Sungard. Meet the brothers preparing for the        attack. Then join them in wiping out the Imperials. Once you prevail        we will garrison the fort. What do you say? Can you do this?",
"That fort is as good as ours.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Good. You've got real fire in you. I like that... Talos guide you.",
"Ulfric: Now that the Empire has been driven from the Reach we can put a stop        to the raping of her silver mines. That silver belongs to Skyrim.        Multitudes of our enemies are buried in an avalanche of pain and        retribution delivered by your hands. I shall call you Snow-Hammer        now. You show great passion for battle, and compassion for those we        fight for. You are becoming indispensable to our cause. We do what we        do out of love for our brothers and sisters. Here, take this as a token        of such love reciprocated.",
"Dragonborn: What's next?",
"Ulfric: You're needed in Hjaalmarch. There's much to be done.",
"What exactly will I be doing out there?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         You'll be doing whatever Galmar tells you to do, and causing as much         mayhem as possible for the Empire and any Jarl who supports them.",
"Understood.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • For Skyrim!         • Talos guide you.",
"Dragonborn: Reporting for duty.",
"Galmar: Need you to deliver some false orders to the Imperial Legate in        Morthal. But first we need to get our hands on some Imperial orders to        make the forgeries. The inns at Dragonbridge¹ and Rorikstead are        frequent stops for Imperial runners. See if you can't 'convince' one of        those innkeepers to help you. One way or another, get me those        documents. What do you say?",
"That fort is as good as ours.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • Don't screw this up.         • Excellent. Put the fear of the Nine into those motherless dogs.",
"Mralki: I tend to keep my patrons' privacy.",
"His life is in danger. (Persuade)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • It is? Well that's different.         • Yeah, sure it is. You don't fool me.",
"Maybe some gold will help (### gold)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • Well, if you insist...         • Seems your purse is lighter than you thought.",
"Never mind.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Hmph.",
"He was here, but he left. If you leave now, you can probably catch        him. Or, you can just wait here. He'll be back soon enough.",
"Courier: Can't stop to chat, citizen.",
"Never mind.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Hmph.",
"Galmar: Good work! Let's see what you got. Hmm... They know more of our plans        than I thought... Not good... Oh, what's this? Fort Snowhawk is in need        of reinforcements... We'll make sure they won't be getting those...        Give me a moment while I make a few, um, 'corrections' to these        reports... There we go. Make sure those forged documents get to the        Legate in Morthal. That should give them the wrong idea...and us the        advantage.",
"Dragonborn: I have important documents for you, sir.",
"Duilis: • Is that so? Lost your uniform along the way did you, soldier?",
"Dragonborn: Ditched it for this. Easier to sneak past the enemy.",
"Thank you, soldier. Let's take a look at these reports... I'm waiting        on word about reinforcements for the fort... Good, they're on the way.        And we have some information on enemy troop movements. Excellent.        Stormcloak scouts are making it difficult to move around. It's good        you made it here in one piece. Why don't you have yourself a drink at        the Moorside before you head back?",
"Galmar: Good job! Ulfric was right about you. I'm glad to have you with us!",
"Dragonborn: Reporting in.",
"Galmar: You're going to Fort Snowhawk. Meet the brothers preparing for the        attack. Then join them in wiping out the Imperials. Once you prevail        we will garrison the fort. What do you say? Can you do this?",
"That fort is as good as ours.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Good. You've got real fire in you. I like that... Talos guide you.",
"Ulfric: Tullius must be getting nervous. Taking Hjaalmarch we're practically        in his backyard now. As soon as we're able, we'll march on Solitude.        You've become a true hero of Skyrim. I number you among my kin. You        shall now be known as Stormblade. The love of the land and her people        flows from your heart, even as death to her enemies flows from your        hands. On behalf of the sons and daughters of Skyrim, on behalf of all        that is righteous and true, take this token of our appreciation for        your service.",
"Dragonborn: What's next?",
"Ulfric: You've no time to glory in your accomplishments. We're gathering for        our final assault on Solitude. I need you there. Report to our camp in        Haafingar.",
"Dragonborn: Reporting in.",
"Galmar: You're going to the fort. Meet the brothers preparing for the attack.        Then join them in wiping out the Imperials. Once you prevail we will        garrison the fort. What do you say? Can you do this?",
"That fort is as good as ours.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Good. You've got real fire in you. I like that... Talos guide you.",
"Galmar: Good job! Ulfric was right about you. I'm glad to have you with us!",
"Dragonborn: How can I help?",
"Galmar: We're taking the city. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack.        Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.",
"Ulfric: This is it men! Time to make this city ours! We come to this moment        carried by the sacrifice and courage of our fellows! Those who have        fallen. And those still bearing shields to our right. On this day, our        enemy will know the fullness of our determination, the true depth of        our anger, and the exalted righteousness of our cause. The gods are        watching. The spirits of our ancestors are stirring. And men under suns        yet to dawn will be transformed by what we do here today. Fear neither        pain, nor darkness. For Sovngarde awaits those who die with weapons in        their hands, and courage in their hearts. We now fight our way to        Castle Dour to cut the head off the Legion itself! And in that moment,        the gods will look down and see Skyrim as she was meant to be. Full of        Nords who are mighty, powerful, and free! Ready now! Everyone, with me!        For the sons and daughters of Skyrim! Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhh!!!!!!",
"Galmar: Already done.",
"Rikke: Dragonborn... Perhaps this is the fate of Skyrim after all. To be       destroyed from the inside.",
"We'll kill you if we must.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        A true Nord never fears death. It's the how and why of it one needs        consider.",
"Rikke, leave. They'll kill you.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        If that must be, then it will. And why should I be any different? So        many lives have already been lost. What's one more?",
"Rikke: Ulfric. Stop.",
"Ulfric: Stop what? Taking Skyrim back from those who'd leave her to rot?",
"Rikke: You're wrong. Ulfric. We need the Empire. Without it Skyrim will       assuredly fall to the Dominion.",
"Galmar: You were there with us. You saw it. The day the Empire signed that        damn treaty was the day the Empire died.",
"Rikke: You're a damn fool.",
"Galmar: Stand aside woman. We've come for the General.",
"Rikke: He has given up. But I have not.",
"Ulfric: Rikke. Go. You're free to leave.",
"Rikke: I'm also free to stay and fight for what I believe in.",
"Ulfric: You're also free to die for it.",
"Rikke: This is what you wanted? Shield brothers and sisters killing each other?       Families torn apart? This is the Skyrim you want?!",
"Galmar: Damnit woman, stand aside!",
"Rikke: That's not the Skyrim I want to live in.",
"Ulfric: Rikke. You don't have to do this.",
"Rikke: You've left me no choice... Talos preserve us.",
"Tullius: Enough...enough...",
"Ulfric: This is it for you. Any last words before I send you to Oblivion?",
"Tullius: You realize this is exactly what they wanted.",
"Galmar: What who wanted?",
"Tullius: The Thalmor. They stirred up trouble here. Forced us to divert needed         resources and throw away good soldiers quelling this rebellion.",
"Ulfric: It's a little more than a rebellion, don't you think?",
"Galmar: Heh.",
"Tullius: We aren't the bad guys you know.",
"Ulfric: Maybe not, but you certainly aren't the good guys.",
"Tullius: Perhaps you're right. But then what does that make you?",
"Ulfric: You said it yourself.",
"Galmar: It makes us right.",
"Tullius: And if I surrender?",
"Ulfric: The Empire I remember never surrendered.",
"Galmar: That Empire is dead. And so are you.",
"Tullius: So be it.",
"Galmar: Just kill him and let's be done with it already.",
"Ulfric: Come, Galmar. Where's your sense of the dramatic moment?",
"Galmar: By the gods! If it's a good ending to some damn story you're after --        perhaps the Dragonborn should be the one to do it.",
"Ulfric: Good point. Well, Dragonborn. What do you say? Do you want the honor?",
"That honor belongs to you.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         As you wish. This moment, we three, will be immortalized in song.",
"Tullius: Aghh..¹",
"Galmar: Good. It's done.",
"Ulfric: Well, I suppose some kind of speech is in order.",
"Galmar: I'll go gather the men in the courtyard.",
"Ulfric: And Elisif?",
"Galmar: Don't you worry about her. I've sent my best men to round her up.",
"Ulfric: Stormblade. I want you to have my sword, a token of my appreciation.        Now then. The men will expect a speech. Will you stand by my side? I        wish to honor you, Dragonborn and the truest of Stormcloaks.",
"Of course, my Lord.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Very good. Come, the people await us.",
"Maybe you should leave me out of your speech.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Oh, why is that?",
"Many have fought and died. I'm no different than they are.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          On the contrary, you exceed the rest. But, I will honor your request.          The gods will know of your victories, and they themselves will glory          in your deeds. Come, at the very least walk out with me.",
"My reasons are my own.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          A man's heart is his own burden to bear, so I will honor your          request, though it casts a bit of gloom on an otherwise glorious          day. Come, at the very least walk out with me.",
"Ulfric: I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak, and at my side the man we know as        Stormblade, and the world knows as the Dragonborn. And indeed, there        are many that call us heroes.",
"Ulfric: • I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak... And indeed, there are many that call          me hero.",
"But it is all of you who are the true heroes! It was you who fought a        dying Empire who sunk its claws into our land, trying to drag us down        with it. It was you who fought the Thalmor and their puppets who would        have us deny our gods and our heritage. It was you who fought your kin        who didn't understand our cause, who weren't willing to pay the price        of our freedom. But more than that, it was you who fought for Skyrim,        for our right to fight our own battles... To return to our glory and        our traditions, to determine our own future! And it is for these        reasons that I cannot accept the mantle of 'High King.' Not until the        Moot declares that title should adorn my shoulders will I accept it.",
"Stormcloak: What about Jarl Elisif?",
"Ulfric: Yes, what about the Lady Elisif? Will she put aside her personal hatred        for me, and her misplaced love for the Emperor and his coin, so that        the suffering of our people will end? Will she acknowledge that it is        we Nord's¹ who will determine Skyrim's future? Will she swear fealty to        me, so all may know we are at peace, and a new day has dawned?",
"Elisif: I do!",
"Ulfric: Then it is settled. The Jarl will continue to rule in Solitude, I will        garrison armies here to ward off Imperial attempts to reclaim the city.        And in due time, the Moot will meet, and settle the claim to High King        once and for all. There is much to do, and I need every able bodied¹        man and woman committed to rebuilding Skyrim. A great darkness is        growing, and soon we will be called to fight it, on these shores or        abroad. The Aldmeri Dominion may have defeated the Empire, but it has        not defeated Skyrim!",
"Stormcloaks: Yyyyyyyaaaaaahhhhhh!",
"Ulfric: How'd I do?",
"Galmar: Eh, not so bad. Nice touch about the High King.",
"Ulfric: Thank you, I thought so, too.",
"Galmar: It's a foregone conclusion, you know.",
"Ulfric: Oh, I know.",
"Galmar: The Imperials aren't going to leave us alone. They still have camps in        the hills. They'll continue to strike out at us, whenever and wherever        they are.",
"Ulfric: I'm not afraid of the remnants of the Legion, in time they'll all give        up and go home. What I fear, is the Thalmor will see our victory here        and turn greater attention to our shores. We must be prepared to face        them.",
"Galmar: Aye.",
"Ulfric: And, of course, we couldn't have done it without you. May the gods        preserve you.",
"Galmar: May the gods preserve us all.",
"Ulfric: Come, Galmar. We've still much work to do.",
"Dragonborn: Is there anything further I can do to help the cause?",
"Ulfric: True sons and daughters of Skyrim reign in every city, we've crippled        the Imperial Legion, and cut off its head by killing General Tullius        himself. What more could I ask of you? No, you're free to roam. I        suspect the gods have needs for you elsewhere. That said, some of the        Legion's staunchest men have organized themselves, and are operating        out of hidden military camps in the wilderness. If you come across any        Imperials in your travels, I expect you'll know what to do.",
"Dragonborn: So, do I call you High King now?",
"Ulfric: No, not yet. We'll wait for the Moot to name me High King. It'll be        better for all that way. But, that doesn't mean I won't start acting        like it. There's much to do. The new Jarls need help building armies,        and enforcing their right to rule. The Empire may try to reclaim        Skyrim, and I need everyone ready for that. Though the biggest threat,        of course, is the elves.",
"Dragonborn: Now that we've defeated the Imperials, will there be peace?",
"Ulfric: There will be peace for a time, during which we must rebuild Skyrim        into the land it once was. Strong. Self-reliant. The center of mankind.        Because getting rid of the Empire was only half the problem. Soon, the        elves will again seek to rule the world. We must ready ourselves to        fight them. For it will be Skyrim that shall lead Tamriel in those        dark days, when the fate of the world is finally determined.",
"Dragonborn: Is there anything further I can do for the cause?",
"Galmar: No. I trust you'll do more good out there in the world, wherever you        damn well please to go. You're a true son of Skyrim. You'll know what        to do. To begin with, killing any Legionnaire you find out in the        wilderness. I've reports they've hidden military camps out there.",
"Dragonborn: What's next for the mighty Galmar Stone-Fist?",
"Galmar: Heh. Ulfric's put me in charge of keeping an eye on the new Jarls. You        know, make sure they're generally following orders. Can't say I'm        looking forward to that. But, I'll also be training men and women for        their new armies. The Empire might send over a few Legionnaires to make        sure we're serious, and of course, we'll be taking the fight to the        elves soon enough. We'll need trained, disciplined and creative        warriors ready for all that.",
"Dragonborn: What do you think about Ulfric, now that he has won?",
"Elisif: Ulfric coveted the High King's throne. He thought he deserved it more        than Torygg. Now it would seem Ulfric has his wish. And there truly is        no justice in the world.",
"Dragonborn: So, do you still claim to be High Queen of Skyrim?",
"Elisif: No. Although it's true my husband Torygg was the High King and I am his        widow, I am in no position to claim such a title. Ulfric Stormcloak is        victorious, and the Jarls have fallen in line. It seems I will never        take my rightful place as High Queen.",
"Brynjolf: Never done an honest day's work in your life for all that coin you're          carrying, eh, lad?",
"Dragonborn: I'm sorry, what?",
"Brynjolf: I'm saying you've got the coin, but you didn't earn a septim of it          honestly. I can tell.",
"How could you possibly know that?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           It's all about sizing up your mark, lad. The way they walk, what           they're wearing. It's a dead giveaway.7",
"My wealth is none of your business.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Oh, but that's where you're wrong, lad. Wealth is my business. Maybe           you'd like a taste?",
"Dragonborn: What do you have in mind?",
"Brynjolf: I've got a bit of an errand to perform, but I need an extra pair of          hands. And in my line of work, extra hands are well-paid.",
"Dragonborn: What do I have to do?",
"Brynjolf: Simple...I'm going to cause a distraction, and you're going to steal          Madesi's silver ring from a strongbox under his stand. Once you          have it, I want you to place it in Brand-Shei's pocket without him          noticing.",
"Why plant the ring on Brand-Shei?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           There's someone that wants to see him put out of business           permanently. That's all you need to know. Now, you tell me when           you're ready and we'll get started.",
"Why are we doing this to Brand-Shei?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             We've been contracted to make Brand-Shei remembers not to meddle             in affairs that are not his own. Now, since we're not the Dark             Brotherhood, we're not going to kill him; we're just going to             make sure he sits in the prisons for a few days.",
"How am I supposed to do all of this?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             Do you want me to hold your hand as well? You're going to have to             sneak over to Madesi's stall and use your lockpick on the             strongbox. Then, when you have the ring, you pickpocket Brand-Shei             and leave it behind.",
"Break the law? Are you kidding?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Sorry...I usually have a nose for this kind of thing. Never mind           then, lad. If you change your mind, come find me.",
"Brynjolf: Everyone! Everyone! Gather 'round! I have something amazing to show          you that demands your attention! This way, everyone! Over here! No          pushing, no shoving. Plenty of room!",
"Brand-Shei: Come on, Brynjolf...what is it this time?",
"Brynjolf: Patience, Brand-Shei. This is a rare opportunity, and I wouldn't want          you to get left out.",
"Madesi: That's what you said about the Wisp Essence and it turned out to be        crushed Nirnroot mixed with water!",
"Brynjolf: Well, that was a simple misunderstanding, but this item is the real          thing. Lads and lasses, I give you, Falmerblood Elixir!",
"Brand-Shei: Oh, come on, are you talking about the Snow Elves?",
"Brynjolf: The one and only. Mystical beings who live in legends and were          masters of great magic. Imagine the power that coursed through their          veins!",
"Madesi: How did you get that then? No one's seen them in years!",
"Brynjolf: My sources must remain a secret for their own protection, but I can          promise you that the contents are genuine. One sip of the elixir and          your wishes will be granted. Great wealth, everlasting life or          perhaps limitless power could be yours!",
"Brand-Shei: How much does it cost?",
"Brynjolf: Only twenty gold septims. Hurry before my supply is gone!",
"Madesi: Why would you even listen to him?",
"Brynjolf: Only twenty septims a bottle!",
"Brand-Shei: I can't afford to get one, but can I afford not to?",
"Brynjolf: Well, I see that my time is up. Come back tomorrow if you wish to          buy.",
"Madesi: What a waste of time.",
"Brand-Shei: Damn. I knew I shouldn't have waited.",
"Brynjolf: Looks like I chose the right person for the job. And here you go...          your payment, as promised. The way things have been going around          here, it's a relief that our plan went off without a hitch.",
"Dragonborn: What's been going on?",
"Brynjolf: Bah. My organization's been having a run of bad luck, but I suppose          that's just how it goes. But never mind that, you did the job and you          did it well. Best of all, there's more where that came from...if you          think you can handle it.",
"The money's nice, but I don't know.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Look, I'll make this simple for you. The group I represent has its           home in the Ratway beneath Riften...a tavern called the Ragged           Flagon. When you make up your mind, come find me there and we can           talk about your future.",
"No way. It was wrong to do those things.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Arrogant, eh? Play it however you want, but listen up. The group I           represent has its home in the Ratway beneath Riften...a tavern           called the Ragged Flagon. When you come to your senses, find me           there and we'll discuss your future.",
"Vekel the Man: Give it up, Brynjolf...those days are over.",
"Brynjolf: I'm telling you, this one is different...",
"Dirge: We've all hear that one before, Bryn! Quit kidding yourself.",
"Vekel the Man: It's time to face the truth, old friend. You, Vex, Mercer...               you're all part of a dying breed. Things are changing!",
"Brynjolf: Dying breed, eh? Well what do you call that then?",
"Brynjolf: Well, well...color me impressed, lad. I wasn't sure I'd ever see you          again!",
"Getting here was easy.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Reliable and headstrong? You're turning out to be quite the prize!           So...now that I've whetted your appetite with our little scheme at           the market, how about handling a few deadbeats for me?",
"Don't know why I bothered. This place is a mess.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           If you were expecting a palace, then maybe you're not cut out for           this line of work. Our methods require secrecy and discretion. Now,           if you're done bellyaching like a child, how about handling a few           deadbeats for me?",
"Dragonborn: Deadbeats? What'd they do?",
"Brynjolf: They owe our organization some serious coin and they've decided not          to pay. I want you to explain to them the error of their ways.",
"Dragonborn: Sounds good. Who are they?",
"Brynjolf: Keerava, Bersi Honey-Hand and Haelga. Do this right and I can promise          you a permanent place in our organization.",
"Dragonborn: How do you want me to handle it?",
"Brynjolf: Honestly, the debt is secondary here. What's more important is you          get the message across that we aren't to be ignored. A word of          warning, though...I don't want any of them killed. Bad for business.",
"Consider it done.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Good. If you need any details on your marks, I'll be here. Get",
"Will I get a cut?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Of course you'll get a cut. We take care of our own. Now, if you           need any details on your marks, I'll be here. Get going.",
"What's Haelga's story?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Haelga is a devout follower of Dibella and dotes over the statue           to the Divine which she keeps at the Bunkhouse. Use it as leverage           and she'll cave.",
"Any tips about Keerava?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Keerava's stubborn, but she's got a soft spot for her family. Talk           to Talen-Jei at the Bee and Barb and see if you can get something           out of him. They're...well-acquainted, if you catch my meaning.",
"Any help with Bersi?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           He's as pig-headed a man as you'll ever find. The key is that ugly           dwarven urn in his shop. Smash that thing to bits and he'll change           his attitude.",
"Dragonborn: I have a message from Brynjolf.",
"Bersi: Wha...what? Oh, it's one of you people. So, Brynjolf doesn't even bother       to show up himself anymore, eh? What's this message?",
"Simple. You don't pay, bad things happen.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Petty threats and fist-waving are not going to sway me. You people are        all talk and everyone knows it!",
"We can protect ourselves. Trust me.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Don't fool yourself. It's only a matter of time before you people are         run out of Riften.",
"We can protect ourselves. Trust me.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         (same as above)",
"Bersi: Please, no more! I'll pay, I'll pay! Here.",
"Bersi: Stop! That's priceless!",
"Drifa: Oh my word!",
"Bersi: No! That urn was priceless!",
"Dragonborn: You want me to break anything else?",
"Bersi: All right! I get it. I'll pay on time from now on. Just don't smash       anything else. Here! Take your gold and leave me in peace.",
"Bersi: I can't believe you're doing this! Stop! No! That urn was priceless!",
"Dragonborn: That was from Brynjolf. Get the message?",
"Bersi: I can't believe you did that! You people are monsters! You demand       payment for protection and you can't even protect yourselves! Here, take       your coin and tell Brynjolf to leave us alone.",
"Bersi: Oh no! You're the one from Brynjolf's outfit, aren't you?",
"Dragonborn: I have a message from Brynjolf.",
"Bersi: Oh! There's no need for that. I know why you're here. Tell Brynjolf not       to worry about it anymore. Oh! And look, I even have the payment I owed.       Here, take it.",
"Dragonborn: I have a message for Brynjolf.",
"Haelga: What does he want now? I already explained to him that you can't get        blood from a stone.",
"This isn't about the money anymore.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Look, I can't make the coin appear out of thin air. Please, be         reasonable. I'll...I'll pay next month.",
"We've run out of patience.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          And so have I. What's the point of paying anyway? Your outfit can't          even fend for itself. I could do better tossing the gold into the          sewer. You can't scare me with your tough talk. I'm not paying you a          single coin.",
"Then you'll pay in more than just coin. (Brawl)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Ha! We'll see about that.",
"Haelga: Here...take your damn coin and get out of here!",
"Haelga: Please! Don't take the statue! It's the only thing of value I have        left!",
"So, should I drop this statue down a well?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Not Lady Dibella! No, please! I can't lose her! I get the message.         Here, take your gold. I hope you choke on it!",
"Haelga: It's you! Please, don't hurt me!",
"Dragonborn: I have a message from Brynjolf.",
"Haelga: I know who you are. You've been terrorizing the entire city. Please,        there's no need for that here. Message understood. Here, I even have        the payment!",
"Dragonborn: I have a message from Brynjolf.",
"Keerava: I've already told that buffoon I'm not paying you people a single         coin!",
"Dragonborn: It was never a request.",
"Keerava: Look around you, I'm barely keeping this rathole together. The war's         seen to that.",
"Don't say I didn't warn you.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Come on, give it your best shot!",
"Keerava: Please, stop! I'll pay up! Take it.",
"Dragonborn: Are you ready to pay Brynjolf what you owe?",
"Keerava: No, and I never will. Now get out of my inn.",
"Dragonborn: Maybe I should visit that farm in Morrowind...",
"Keerava: How could you possibly know about... Please. My family means too much         to me. Don't hurt them.",
"Dragonborn: Then pay up and I'll forget about it.",
"Keerava: Very well. Here. Take this back to Brynjolf and tell him he'll have         no more trouble from me.",
"Dragonborn: I have a message from Brynjolf.",
"Keerava: Look, everything was all just a misunderstanding. I didn't mean to         tell Brynjolf to go jump off the pier. You'll tell him I'm sorry, yes?         Take this. Every single coin I owe is there, I swear.",
"Brynjolf: So, job's done and you even brought the gold. Best of all, you did it          clean. I like that. Dumping bodies and keeping the guards quiet can          be expensive.",
"Dragonborn: Here's what they owed us.",
"Brynjolf: Well done. And it would seem I owe you something in return. Here you          go, I think you'll find these quite useful.",
"Dragonborn: What's next, then?",
"Brynjolf: Judging from how well you've handled those shopkeepers, I'd say          you've done more than simply prove yourself. We need people like you          in our outfit.",
"Dragonborn: If there's more gold where that came from, I'm in.",
"Brynjolf: That's the spirit! Larceny's in your blood...the telltale sign of a          practiced thief. I think you'll do more than just fit in around here.",
"Dragonborn: Before we go, I have to ask...",
"Brynjolf: What's on your mind?",
"Dragonborn: Word is your outfit isn't doing well. True?",
"Brynjolf: We've run into a rough patch lately, but it's nothing to be concerned          about. Tell you what: you keep making us coin and I'll worry about          everything else. Fair enough?",
"Dragonborn: Fair enough.",
"Brynjolf: Now if there are no more questions, how about following me and I'll          show you what you're all about.",
"Brynjolf: Mercer? This is the one I was talking about...our new recruit.",
"Mercer Frey: This better not be another waste of the Guild's resources,             Brynjolf. Before we continue, I want to make one thing perfectly             clear. If you play by the rules, you walk away rich. You break             the rules and you lose your share. No debates, no discussions...             you do what we say, when we say. Do I make myself clear?",
"Yes, I understand.             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              Good. Then I think it's time we put your expertise to the test.",
"Rules? We're thieves. What's the point of rules?             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              I'll let that comment go because you're new here. Ask things out              of turn again, and we have a problem. Now, are we clear on all              of this?",
"Brynjolf: Wait a moment... You're not talking about Goldenglow, are you? Even          our little Vex couldn't get in.",
"Mercer: You claim this recruit possesses an aptitude for our line of work. If        so, let him prove it. Goldenglow Estate is critically important to one        of our largest clients. However, the owner has suddenly decided to take        matters into his own hands, and shut us out. He needs to be taught a        lesson. Brynjolf will provide you with the details.",
"Brynjolf: Mercer, aren't you forgetting something?",
"Mercer: Hmm? Oh, yes... Since Brynjolf assures me you'll be nothing but a        benefit to us, then you're in. Welcome to the Thieves Guild.",
"Brynjolf: Welcome to the family, lad. I'm expecting you to make us a lot of          coin, so don't disappoint me.",
"Dragonborn: So how do I get my cut of the spoils?",
"Brynjolf: Simple. Do as you're told and keep your blade clean. We can't turn a          profit by killing. You should talk with Delvin Mallory and Vex. They          know their way around this place and they'll be able to kick some          extra jobs your way. Oh, and talk to Tonilia in the Flagon...she'll          set you up with your new armor.",
"Dragonborn: Tell me about the Goldenglow job.",
"Brynjolf: Goldenglow Estate is a bee farm; they raise the wretched little          things for honey. It's run by some smart-mouth wood elf named          Aringoth. We need you to teach him a lesson by burning down three of          his estate's hives",
"Dragonborn: What's the catch?",
"Brynjolf: The catch is that you can't burn the whole place to the ground. That          important client Mercer mentioned would be furious if you did.",
"Who cares, we're the Thieves Guild.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           That's not how things work around here. The Guild depends on an           arrangement of influential people to keep things running smoothly.           Without them at our backs, we'd be in serious trouble.",
"Makes sense.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Aye, the last thing we want to be doing is crossing our clients.                     What's so important about these clients?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           The guild depends on an arrangement of influential people to keep           things running smoothly. Without them at our backs, we'd be in           serious trouble.",
"Dragonborn: What should I do about Aringoth?",
"Brynjolf: Maven prefers that Aringoth remains alive, but if he tries to stop          you from getting the job done, kill him. The Guild has a lot riding          on this. Don't make me look foolish by mucking it up.",
"Mercenaries? Not Riften guards?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             Aye. Aringoth sent the city guard packing and fortified the entire             island. In fact, Vex barely made it out of there alive. You should             talk to her about it before you go.",
"How do I destroy the bee hives?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           They're built like small fortresses to resist the weather, but their           one weakness is flame. Besides, nothing tells the people of Riften           we mean business than a huge column of smoke.",
"Why not level the entire estate?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯",
"Maven Black-Briar is the influential client?             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              We had an arrangement with Maven. We kept an eye on Goldenglow              Estate to make sure the honey kept flowing. If the workers had a              dispute, we rough them up. If competitors tried to buy honey from              Aringoth, we'd steal the shipments. In return, Maven allowed us              to extort Aringoth and bring in a huge payout.",
"So, how dangerous is it to cross her?               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                Let me put it to you this way: nothing happens in Riften                without Maven's consent. One word from her and you could spend                the rest of the fourth era in prison.",
"Brynjolf: You watch yourself on that island. Those mercenaries don't take          prisoners.",
"Dragonborn: I heard you ran into trouble at Goldenglow.",
"Vex: Hmph, yeah, I did. That wood elf s'wit...he's a lot smarter than I     expected. Can you believe that fetcher had more than tripled the guard?     There must have been eight of them in there. It was like he was daring us     to come and get him.",
"Dragonborn: Any tips to get me in there?",
"Vex: Well, there's an old sewer tunnel that dumps into the lake on the     northwest side of the island. That's how I slipped in there. Should still     be unguarded.",
"Aringoth: Worthless mercenaries. I didn't think Maven or Mercer would allow          me to get away with this, but I had little choice.",
"Dragonborn: I just want the key to your safe.",
"Aringoth: I can't. If I do, I may as well cut my own throat.",
"What makes you think I won't? (Persuade)          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I don't believe you. That's not your way.",
"Then I'll take it off your corpse!          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Give it your best shot!",
"Forget it. I'll just open it myself.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           No! I'm not about to let you ruin everything I've worked so hard           for!",
"Brynjolf: You've made a mess and Maven is furious. I told you not to burn more          than three of the hives! I've smoothed things over with her for now,          but you can forget your cut.",
"Dragonborn: Sorry. Here's what was in the safe.",
"Brynjolf: At least you remembered one of the things I asked. Let me see that.",
"Brynjolf: Word on the street is Goldenglow's been hit. Good job.",
"Dragonborn: Yes, and here's what was in the safe.",
"Brynjolf: Let me take a look at what you found. Aringoth sold Goldenglow?          What's that idiot thinking? He has no idea the extent of Maven's fury          when she's been cut out of a deal, but I'm certain he'll find out. If          only the parchment had the buyer's name instead of this odd symbol.          Any idea what that may be?",
"Dragonborn: No idea.",
"Brynjolf: Blast. Well, I'll check my sources and ask Mercer. But for now,          you're off to speak with Maven Black-Briar. She asked for you by          name.",
"Good, it's about time I met her.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Don't sound so eager, it's not a social visit. It's business.",
"Sure, but will I come out of there alive?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Ha ha. If it was like that she wouldn't be asking for you, she'd           be calling the Dark Brotherhood. It's just business.",
"Dragonborn: What does Maven want from me?",
"Brynjolf: That's between you and Maven and I prefer to keep it that way.",
"Dragonborn: Speaking of which...",
"Brynjolf: Of course...your pay. Haha! You're smart as a whip, lad. Keep doing          right by us and there'll be plenty more where that came from.",
"Maven Black-Briar: So you're the one who burned down Goldenglow Estate. Do you                   have any idea what that little stunt you pulled is going to                   cost me? I'm amazed you even bothered to show your face                   here.",
"Dragonborn: My apologies, Lady Maven.",
"Maven: The only reason we're having this conversation is due to Brynjolf's       assurance you won't botch another assignment. He claims you possess some       sort of uncanny aptitude for your line of work. Quite frankly I find       that hard to believe.",
"Maven: So, you're the one. Hmm. You don't look so impressive.",
"Sorry you're disappointed.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        This is exactly what I'm talking about. Once again Brynjolf sends me        someone with no backbone, no determination.",
"How about we skip the conversation?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       You have to understand, it's been a long time since Brynjolf's sent me       anyone I can rely on.",
"Dragonborn: You have no faith in the guild?",
"Maven: Faith? I don't have faith in anyone. All I care about is cause and       effect. Did the job get done and was it done correctly. There's no gray       area.",
"You won't have that problem with me.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        I hope not. This is an important job. I have a competitor called        Honningbrew Meadery that I want to put out of business. I also want to        know how they got the place up and running so quickly.",
"Where do I begin?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Head to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun and ask for Mallus Maccius.        He'll fill you in on all the details.",
"Dragonborn: Who runs the Honningbrew Meadery?",
"Maven: Some layabout named Sabjorn. Been a thorn in my side for the last few       years now.",
"Dragonborn: Sabjorn seems like more than just friendly competition.",
"Maven: Not a day goes by that I don't regret letting Sabjorn get as far as he       did. In only a few short years, he's taken that bile he calls mead to       market and a chunk of my profits with it! I can't imagine where he       found the gold to take it to market so quickly.",
"Dragonborn: So get rid of him and he's no longer a threat.",
"Maven: Exactly. With Sabjorn in prison, his meadery will be forced to close.       Then I swoop in and take over the place. No more competition.",
"Dragonborn: Why strike now?",
"Maven: The Goldenglow Estate job has undoubtedly interrupted the supply of       honey that I need to make my mead. Sabjorn could use this interruption       to his advantage and take a larger share of the market. I can't have       that.",
"Dragonborn: How did you become Allied with the Thieves Guild?",
"Maven: The Black-Briar family has always been allied with the Guild. Our       connections with the Empire and within Skyrim make for a perfect fit. I       dare say the Guild owes its survival as much to my family as it does       to its own people.",
"Maven: One more time in case I wasn't clear. You butcher this job and you'll be       sorry.",
"Mallus Maccius: Can't a man drink in peace?",
"Dragonborn: Maven said you're expecting me.",
"Mallus: I'm going to keep this short 'cause we've got a lot to do.        Honningbrew's owner, Sabjorn, is about to hold a tasting for Whiterun's        Captain of the Guard, and we're going to poison the mead.",
"Dragonborn: You have the poison?",
"Mallus: No, no. That's the beauty of the whole plan. We're going to get Sabjorn        to give it to us. The meadery has quite a pest problem and the whole        city knows about it. Pest poison and mead don't mix well, you know what        I mean?",
"Dragonborn: How do I fit in?",
"Mallus: You're going to happen by and lend poor old Sabjorn a helping hand.        He's going to give you the poison to use on the pests, but you're also        going to dum it into the brewing vat.",
"Dragonborn: Clever.",
"Mallus: Maven and I spent weeks planning this. All we need is someone like you        to get in there and get it done. Now get going before Sabjorn grows a        brain and hires someone else to do the dirty work.",
"How do I get to the brewing vats?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Both of the buildings are connected by tunnels made by the pests         infesting the meadery. There's an entrance to it in the basement         storeroom of the warehouse that used to be boarded over. I've already         removed the boards so the meadery would be infested. That's where you         should start.",
"What about just going in through the brewery?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Sabjorn keeps that locked up tight. If you can get through that way,          go right ahead.",
"Why are you doing all this?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I made the mistake of borrowing coin from Sabjorn. He's allowing me to         pay it back, but he's working my fingers to the bone! He treats me         like a slave...I have to do every nasty, dirty job in the meadery.",
"There's more to this than a debt, isn't there?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          If this plan works, not only is my debt gone, but I'll be set up for          life. Maven and I worked out a little deal. If Sabjorn ends up in          jail, she's going to take over his meadery. And guess who gets to run          the Black-Briar Meadery in Whiterun? You're looking at him.",
"Why bother poisoning the nest for Sabjorn?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Once Sabjorn is out of the way, Maven has plans for this place. One         way or another, we don't want the pests coming back. Consider it just         more of the dirty work. I did my part getting them in there, now you         need to clear them out.",
"Remember, Sabjorn will be needing a helping hand. Make it look good.",
"Sabjorn: What are you gawking at? Can't you see I have problems here?",
"Dragonborn: Is something wrong?",
"Sabjorn: Are you kidding me? Look at this place. I'm supposed to be holding a         tasting of the new Honningbrew Reserve for the Captain of the Guard.         If he sees the meadery in this state, I'll be ruined.",
"Dragonborn: I might be able to help.",
"Sabjorn: Oh really? And I don't suppose you'd just do it out of the kindness         of your heart, would you? I hope you're not expecting to be paid         until the job's done.",
"That's the only way I operate. (Persuade)         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Well that's not how I operate, so forget it.",
"You better, or I yell 'skeever.' (Intimidate)         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Okay, okay. No need to make rash decisions. Here's half. You get the          rest when the job's done. My only demand is that these vermin are          permanently eliminated before my reputation is completely destroyed.",
"Just pay me when the job's done.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          My only demand is that these vermin are permanently eliminated before          my reputation is completely destroyed.",
"Dragonborn: How do I 'permanently' clear the vermin?",
"Sabjorn: I bought some poison. I was going to have my lazy, good-for-nothing         assistant Mallus handle it, but he seems to have vanished. If you         plant this in the vermin's nest, it should stop them from ever coming         back.",
"Dragonborn: You've got a deal.",
"Sabjorn: Don't come back until every one of those things are dead.",
"You mentioned someone named Mallus?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Mallus is the best deal I've ever made. Lent him a bit of gold some          time ago I knew he'd never be able to pay back. Nothing like free          labor to make operating costs cheaper.",
"Now I've got to clean up this mess.",
"Dragonborn: Job's finished.",
"Sabjorn: Well it's about time! I had to stall the captain until you were         finished.",
"Dragonborn: What about my pay?",
"Sabjorn: You'll just have to wait until after the captain's finished. I         suppose you can wait around if you must.",
"Commander Caius: Well, Sabjorn, now that you've taken care of your little                 pest problem, how about I get a taste of some of your mead?",
"Sabjorn: Help yourself, milord. It's my finest brew yet...I call it Honningbrew         Reserve. I think you'll find it quite pleasing to your palate.",
"Caius: Oh, come now. This is mead, not some wine meant to be sipped and       savored. By the Eight?! What...what's in this?",
"Sabjorn: I...I don't know. What's wrong?",
"Caius: You assured me this place was clean! I'll see...see to it that you       remain in irons for the rest of your days!",
"Sabjorn: No, please! I don't understand...",
"Caius: Silence, idiot! I should have known better...to trust this place after       it's been riddled with filth.",
"Sabjorn: I beg you...please! This is not what it seems!",
"Caius: You...you're in charge until I can sort this all out.",
"Mallus: It will be my pleasure.",
"Caius: And you...you're coming with me to Dragonsreach. We'll see how quickly       your memory cleans in the city's prisons. Now move.",
"Mallus: Look, I assure you, this is all just a huge misunderstanding!",
"Caius: I said move!",
"Mallus: Farewell, Sabjorn.",
"Mallus: I don't think that could have gone any better. Anything else you need        before you head back to Riften?",
"Dragonborn: I need to get a look at Sabjorn's books.",
"Mallus: So, Maven wants to hunt down Sabjorn's private partner, huh? You're        welcome to take a look around Sabjorn's office. He keeps most of his        papers stashed in his desk. Here, this should help.",
"What are you going to do with this place?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Start changing it over to the Black-Briar Meadery as soon as possible.         That was Maven's part of the deal. She's put me in charge of keeping         the mead flowing, so that's exactly what I'm going to do. If you're         in the area and you ever need anything fenced, you just let me know.",
"You never mentioned that lunatic living in the tunnels.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I thought it would be better to leave some of the details out of our         previous discussion. Didn't want to risk you walking away from the         job. Besides, you've done Maven a favor getting rid of him and saved         me from wasting coin hiring someone else to do it later.",
"Remember to put in a good word with Maven for me.",
"Maven: I trust you have good news for me.",
"Dragonborn: Job's finished. Here's the information you requested.",
"Maven: This doesn't tell me much. The only thing that can identify Sabjorn's       partner is this odd little symbol.",
"Dragonborn: Yes. I've seen that symbol before.",
"Maven: Well, whoever this mysterious marking represents, they'll regret       starting a war with me. You should bring this information to the       Thieves Guild immediately. There's also the matter of your payment. I       believe you'll find this more than adequate for your services.",
"Brynjolf: Word on the street is that poor Sabjorn has found himself in          Whiterun's prison. How unfortunate for him.",
"Dragonborn: Yet very fortunate for Maven.",
"Brynjolf: Exactly! Now you're beginning to see how our little system works.          Maven sent word that you'd discovered something else while you were          out there. Something important to the Guild?",
"Dragonborn: The same symbol from Goldenglow was involved.",
"Brynjolf: Then this is beyond coincidence. First Aringoth and now Sabjorn.          Someone's trying to take us down by driving a wedge between Maven          and the Guild.",
"Dragonborn: Is there anything we can do?",
"Brynjolf: Mercer thinks he knows a way to identify this new thorn in our side.          He wants to meet with you right away. And if I were you, I'd hurry.          I've never seen him this angry before.",
"Mercer: Ah, there you are. I've consulted my contacts regarding the information        you recovered from Goldenglow Estate, but no one can identify that        symbol.",
"Dragonborn: I found the same marking at Honningbrew Meadery.",
"Mercer: It would see our adversary is attempting to take us apart indirectly by        angering Maven Black-Briar. Very clever.",
"You admire them?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         They're well-funded and they've been able to avoid identification for         years. I'm surprised it reached this point. Just don't mistake my         admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly.",
"Maybe we should recruit them.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        You just, but they've been able to avoid detection for years. They're        obviously well-funded, driven and patient. Just don't mistake my        admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly.",
"Clever or not, they need to die.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Don't dismiss our adversary so easily. They're well-funded, patient         and have been able to avoid identification for years. However, don't         mistake my admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay         dearly.",
"Dragonborn: How can we make them pay?",
"Mercer: Because, even after all their posturing and planning, they've made a        mistake. The parchment you recovered mentions a 'Gajul-Lei'. According        to my sources, that's an old alias used by one of our contacts. His        real name is Gulum-Ei. Slimy bastard.",
"Dragonborn: Where do I begin?",
"Mercer: Gulum-Ei is our inside man at the East Empire Company in Solitude. I'm        betting he acted as a go-between for the sale of Goldenglow Estate and        that he can finger our buyer. Get out there, shake him down and see        what you come up with. Talk to Brynjolf before you leave if you have        any questions.",
"Aringoth was a fool to think he could get away with this.",
"Brynjolf: I can't believe Gulum-Ei's mixed up in all this; that Argonian          couldn't find his tail with both hands. Don't get me wrong. He could          scam a beggar out of his last septim...but he's no mastermind.",
"Dragonborn: Think he'll give me trouble?",
"Brynjolf: Trouble? He's one of the most stubborn lizards I've ever met! You          have your work cut out for you.",
"Dragonborn: So how do I get him to talk?",
"Brynjolf: You're going to have to buy him off; it's the only way to get his          attention. If that fails, follow him and see what he's up to. If I          know Gulum-Ei, he's in way over his head and you'll be able to use          it as leverage.",
"Betrayal or not, I'll let him live.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I'm glad to see you're embracing our methods. It would be a waste to           lose a contact at the East Empire Company before we had the entire           story. Just keep on Gulum-Ei's tail and he's bound to step in           something he can't scrape off his boot.",
"He's going to owe us for this betrayal.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Aye, he does indeed...and with his fingers in the East Empire           Company's pie, we'll make good use of that debt. If I'm not being           clear enough, that means we don't want him killed. For now, just           keep on his tail and he's bound to step in something he can't scrape           off his boot.",
"If he's betrayed us, I'll kill him.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           No, no, Mercer wants him alive. For now. Stubborn or not, he's the           only contact we have at the East Empire Company. Just keep on his           tail and he's bound to step in something he can't scrape off his           boot.",
"East Empire Company? Who are they?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           A mercantile group that has established ports all over Tamriel. They           pretty much dominate the whole shipping industry. The Emperor           himself supposedly backs them, which means they have fairly           unlimited resources...so don't get their feathers in a ruffle.",
"If I get information from Gulum-Ei, what then?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Just head right back to the Guild and get the information to Mercer.           Nothing else is more important. If you discover Gulum-Ei's holding           out on us and hs more loot stashed away than he claims, we'd find           that information quite valuable as well.",
"You think Gulum-Ei will give me trouble?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           There are thieves and there is Gulum-Ei. No honor, no code at all.           He'd shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time. The           cut he's supposed to provide the Guild has dwindled as of late. He           says pickings in the warehouse are slim, but I'm certain he's lying.           Keep your eyes on him; he's quite crafty.",
"How is Gulum-Ei an asset to the Guild?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Gulum-Ei works in the East Empire Company warehouse. He helps           maintain all of the shipments of goods that goes in and out of           Solitude. That means he has the pick of the litter from some of the           finest goods to grace Skyrim's shores. He isn't exactly in the           Guild, but he pays us a cut of all the stuff he lifts from the           warehouse.",
"Good luck in Solitude. Keep Gulum-Ei alive, but remind him who we          are.",
"Gulum-Ei: So, what do we have here? Hmm...let me guess. By your scent, I'd say          you were from the Guild. But that can't be true, because I told          Mercer I wouldn't deal with them anymore.",
"Dragonborn: I'm here about Goldenglow Estate.",
"Gulum-Ei: I don't deal in land or property. Now, if you're looking for goods,          you've come to the right person.",
"Dragonborn: You can drop the act now...Gajul-Lei.",
"Gulum-Ei: Oh, wait...did you say Goldenglow Estate? My apologies. I'm sorry to          say I know very little about that...bee farm, was it?",
"Dragonborn: You acted as a broker for its new owner.",
"Gulum-Ei: Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. I can't be expected to remember every          deal I handle.",
"Identify the buyer and we'll forget what we know. (Persuade)          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I don't care what you promise. If I tell you the buyer's name and           word gets around, it could ruin me!",
"What would it take to identify the buyer? (Bribe)          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Well, now that you mention it, there is something I've been trying           to get my hands on. I have a buyer looking for a case of Firebrand           Wine. There just so happens to be a single case in the Blue Palace.           Bring it to me, and we'll talk about Goldenglow Estate.",
"Give me the buyer's name or I'll kill you. (Intimidate)          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Hasn't Mercer Frey taught you people anything? You kill me and your           only contact with the East Empire Company vanishes. That's not smart           for business.",
"Dragonborn: I have the Firebrand Wine.",
"Gulum-Ei: Ah, I see you have the wine. Hand it over and we'll talk. Good. Can't          have the buyer getting impatient and looking elsewhere for this, can          we? Here, take this. I certainly can't use it, but I suppose I need          to pay you something for the goods.",
"Dragonborn: You're trying to bribe me now?",
"Gulum-Ei: Not at all. I consider it an investment in prolonging my life. As far          as Goldenglow Estate goes, I'll tell you what I know. I was          approached by a woman who wanted me to act as the broker for          something big. She flashed a bag of gold in my face and said all I          had to do was pay Aringoth for the estate. I brought him the coin and          walked away with her copy of the deed.",
"Dragonborn: Did she say why she was doing this?",
"Gulum-Ei: Not at all. I tend not to ask too many questions when I'm on the          job. I'm sure you understand. However, I did notice she was quite          angry and it was being directed at Mercer Frey.",
"Dragonborn: That's it? No name or anything?",
"Gulum-Ei: In this business we rarely deal in names; our identity comes from how          much coin we carry.",
"Dragonborn: I think you're lying to me.",
"Gulum-Ei: Look, that's all I know. I never promised you I'd have all the          answers. Now, since our transaction is done, I'll be on my way.",
"Gulum-Ei: Now, there's no need to do anything rash... This isn't as bad as it          seems. I was going to tell Mercer about everything, honestly!          Please...he'll have me killed!",
"Mercer doesn't have to know.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I see you wish to be reasonable. Perhaps I misjudged you. The name           of the person you want is Karliah.",
"Tell me first, and then I'll decide.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Alright, alright... It's Karliah...her name is Karliah.",
"Tell me now or I'll kill you where you stand!          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           No, please! There's no need for that! I'll tell you everything. It's           Karliah...her name is Karliah.",
"Dragonborn: You say that name like I should know it.",
"Gulum-Ei: Mercer never told you about her? Karliah is the thief responsible for          murdering the previous Guild Master, Gallus. Now she's after Mercer.",
"Dragonborn: And you're helping her?",
"Gulum-Ei: Help...? No, no! Look, I didn't even know it was her until after she          contacted me. Please, you have to believe me!",
"Dragonborn: Where is Karliah now?",
"Gulum-Ei: I don't know. When I asked her where she was going, she just          muttered 'where the end began'. Here, take the Goldenglow Estate          deed as proof. And when you speak to Mercer, tell him I'm worth more          to him alive.",
"Why did Karliah purchase Goldenglow Estate?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I asked her the same thing and she wouldn't come out and tell me.           But now that I know who she is, I'd say she's trying to hit the           Thieves Guild where it hurts.",
"How would that hurt the guild?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Maven Black-Briar needs Goldenglow's honey for her mead. She's been            using the Guild to keep the Estate under her thumb. If the owner            cuts the Guild out of the picture, he's cutting Maven out of the            picture...which she can't afford. If I was Maven, I'd blame the            Guild for weakening and not being able to handle the place.",
"Which makes Maven lose faith in us.            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             Exactly. For the Guild to survive, they need Maven's support. This             Karliah must have spent a lot of time and resources planning this.",
"Now, you won't forget to tell Mercer I cooperated, will you?",
"Mercer: Did Gulum-Ei give up any information on our buyer?",
"Dragonborn: He said Goldenglow was purchased by a 'Karliah'.",
"Mercer: No, it...it can't be. I haven't heard that name in decades. This is        grave news indeed, she's someone I hoped to never cross paths with        again.",
"Dragonborn: Gulum-Ei also told me she was a murderer.",
"Mercer: Karliah destroyed everything this guild stood for. She murdered my        predecessor in cold blood and betrayed the Guild. After we discovered        what she'd done, we spent months trying to track her down, but she just        vanished.",
"Dragonborn: Why has she returned?",
"Mercer: Karliah and I were like partners. I went with her on every heist. We        watched each other's backs. I know her techniques, her skills. If she        kills me, there'll be no one left that could possibly catch her. If        only we knew where she was...",
"Dragonborn: Gulum-Ei told me she said, 'Where the end began.'",
"Mercer: There's only one place that could be. The place where she murdered        Gallus...a ruin called Snow Veil Sanctum. We have to go out there        before she disappears again.",
"Dragonborn: We?",
"Mercer: Yes, I'm going with you and together we're going to kill her. Here's        your payment for Solitude. Prepare yourself and meet me at the ruins        as soon as you can. We can't let her slip through our fingers.",
"Mercer: Good, you're finally here. I've scouted the ruins and I'm certain        Karliah is still inside.",
"Dragonborn: You saw her?",
"Mercer: No, I found her horse. Don't worry, I've taken care of it...she won't        be using it to escape. Let's get moving, I want to catch her inside        while she's distracted. Take the lead.",
"You want me to lead?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I'm sorry, I was under the impression I was in charge. You're leading         and I'm following. Does that seem clear to you?",
"Understood.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Just make certain you keep your eyes open. Karliah is as sharp as a         blade. The last thing I need is you blundering into a trap and warning         her that we're here.",
"How did Gallus die?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Twenty-five years ago, I was standing outside these very same ruins.         Gallus told me to meet here but he wouldn't say why. When I arrived,         Gallus stepped from the shadows. Before he uttered a sound, an arrow         pierced his throat. Before I could even draw my blade, her second         arrow found its mark in my chest.",
"So Karliah took on both of you alone?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Karliah was a master marksman and her greatest weapon was the element          of surprise. I was lucky...she missed my heart by mere inches. I          staggered away from the ruins and my vision began to blur. It's then          that I realized the bitch had poisoned her arrows.",
"And Gallus?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           The last thing I saw was Karliah dumping his body into an opening           atop the ruins; an unceremonious end for a remarkable man. To this           day, I've regretted letting her escape, even if it had meant I died           trying. I owed Gallus that much.",
"What happened after Gallus died?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            The Guild was thrown into disarray. Several stepped up and tried to            claim Gallus' former position as Guild Master. Sides quickly formed            behind these men and the Ratway became a bloodbath.",
"And you were a part of this?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             I saw what they did to Gallus. I wanted to use the Guild's             resources to hunt down Karliah. The others didn't even care he was             gone. Fortunately, I perservered and the other groups were either             killed or they left Skyrim.",
"And what of Karliah?             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              The in-fighting had taken months to subside, which gave her time              to go into hiding and carefully cover her tracks. I spent              thousands of septims and used every contact at my disposal, but              it was as if she had simply vanished...like I said before, she              was the best.",
"Tell me about Karliah.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         She was a stubborn Dunmer...always had to do everything her way. But         she was also the best...bringing in more coin a month than some         thieves heist in a year. Gallus trusted her too much and let her get         too close.",
"So, they had a relationship.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           If you want to call it that, yes. Me? I think she was softening him           for the kill. Gallus would call her his 'little nightingale'. He was           absolutely smitten by her.",
"Why did she kill him?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Greed? Jealousy? Spite? Who can say what drove her to such an            iniquitous act. One thing's certain: I intend to find out before            she draws her last breath.",
"Isn't murder Dark Brotherhood territory?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I have a long-standing arrangement with the Dark Brotherhood. If I         need someone in the Guild taken care of, we do it ourselves. We both         agree it's best to keep these matters in-house.",
"Let's get going. I want her head on my mantle.",
"Mercer: They say that these ancient Nordic burial mounds are sometimes        impenetrable. This one doesn't look too difficult. Quite simple,        really. I don't know what all the fuss is about these locks. All it        takes is a bit of know-how and a lot of skill. That should do it.        After you.",
"Mercer: The stench in here...this place smells of death. Be on your guard.        Pull the chain over there and watch out for the spikes. Looks like        Karliah reset all the traps.",
"Mercer: Karliah always was a nimble minx...slipping past these draugr must be        child's play for her. We're on the right track. She's been through        here as well.",
"Mercer: That door up ahead...looks perfect for hiding an ambush. Be ready.",
"Mercer: Ah, it's one of the infamous Nordic puzzle doors. How quaint. Without        the matching claw, they're normally impossible to open. And since I'm        sure Karliah already did away with it, we're on our own. Fortunately,        these doors have a weakness if you know how to exploit it. Quite        simple, really.",
"Mercer: Karliah's close, I'm certain of it. Now let's get moving.",
"Mercer: Do you honestly think your arrow will reach me before my blade finds        your heart?",
"Karliah: Give me a reason to try.",
"Mercer: You're a clever girl, Karliah. Buying Goldenglow Estate and funding        Honningbrew Meadery was inspired.",
"Karliah: 'To ensure an enemy's defeat, you must first undermine his allies.' It         was the first lesson Gallus taught us.",
"Mercer: You always were a quick study.",
"Karliah: Not quick enough, otherwise Gallus would still be alive.",
"Mercer: Gallus had his wealth and he had you. All he had to do was look the        other way.",
"Karliah: Did you forget the oath we took as Nightingales? Did you expect him         to simply ignore your methods?",
"Mercer: Enough of this mindless banter! Come, Karliah! It's time for you and        Gallus to become reunited!",
"Karliah: I'm no fool, Mercer. Crossing blades with you would be a death         sentence. But I can promise the next time we meet, it will be your         undoing.",
"Mercer: How interesting. It appears Gallus's history has repeated itself.        Karliah has provided me the means to be rid of you, and this ancient        tomb becomes your final resting place. But do you know what intrigues        me the most? The fact that this was all possible because of you.        Farewell. I'll be certain to give Brynjolf your regards.",
"Karliah: Easy, easy. Don't get up so quickly. How are you feeling?",
"Dragonborn: Hold on...you shot me!",
"Karliah: No, I saved your life. My arrow was tipped with a unique paralytic         poison. It slowed your heart and kept you from bleeding out. Had I         intended to kill you, we wouldn't be having this conversation.",
"Dragonborn: Why save me?",
"Karliah: My original intention was to use that arrow on Mercer, but I never had         a clear shot. I made a split-second decision to get you out of the         way and it prevented your death.",
"Then I'm in your debt.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          More than you'll ever realize.",
"Why should I believe you?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Without the antidote I administered, you'd be as still as a statue.          I treated your wounds and didn't leave you defenseless.",
"You should have shot Mercer instead.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I promise you, the thought crossed my mind.",
"The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough         for a single shot. All I had hoped was to capture Mercer alive.",
"Dragonborn: Why capture Mercer alive?",
"Karliah: Mercer must be brought before the Guild to answer for what he's done.         He needs to pay for Gallus' murder.",
"Dragonborn: How will you prove it now?",
"Karliah: My purpose in using Snow Veil Sanctum to ambush Mercer wasn't simply         for irony's sake. Before both of you arrived, I recovered a journal         from Gallus' remains. I suspect the information we need is written         inside.",
"Dragonborn: Well, what's it say?",
"Karliah: I wish I knew. The journal is written in some sort of language I've         never seen before.",
"Dragonborn: Perhaps it could be translated.",
"Karliah: Enthir...Gallus' friend at the College of Winterhold. Of course...         It's the only outside Gallus trusted with the knowledge of his         Nightingale identity.",
"Dragonborn: There's that word again, 'Nightingale'.",
"Karliah: There were three of us: Myself, Gallus and Mercer. We were an         anonymous splinter of the Thieves Guild in Riften. Perhaps I'll tell         you more about it later. Right now, you need to head for Winterhold         with the journal and get the translation. Here, take these as well,         they may prove useful for your journey.",
"Can't you come with me to Winterhold?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I'm afraid not. There are preparations to make and Gallus' remains          to lay to rest. I promise to join you there as soon as I can.",
"Tell me about Gallus.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          He was a scholar, a master thief and a natural leader. Everyone          respected him and followed him without question. It was Gallus who          inducted me into the Nightingales and honed my skills to a          razor-sharp point. I owe everything to him. We were...very close.",
"You were lovers?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Gallus once said he felt comfortable around me; able to let his           guard down. I can't help but think that I'm responsible for what           happened to him.",
"Why didn't you kill Mercer?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Mercer lied to the Guild, branded me a murderer and slandered my name          across his network of contacts. For twenty-five years I ran, never          sleeping in the same place twice and carefully covering my tracks.          Mercer doesn't need to die...he needs to feel the cold sting of fate          as his life crumbles in front of him and he's hunted by the Guild.",
"Might not have a choice next time.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I can promise you if it comes to that, and my back's to the wall, I           won't hesitate.",
"Remember, speak only to Enthir. Trust no one else.",
"Enthir: Yes, yes, what is it?",
"Dragonborn: I've been sent by Karliah.",
"Enthir: Karliah? Then she's finally found it. Do you have Gallus' journal?",
"Dragonborn: Yes, but there's a problem.",
"Enthir: A problem? Let me see it. This is just like Gallus. A dear friend, but        always too clever for his own good. He's written all of the text in        the Falmer language.",
"Dragonborn: Can you translate it?",
"Enthir: No. However, I know someone who might. The court wizard of Markarth,        Calcelmo, may have the materials you need to get this journal        translated. A word of warning: Calcelmo is a fierce guardian of his        research. Getting the information won't be easy.",
"What exactly is a Falmer?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         In the time before man, they were known as the snow elves. They lived         in the sunlight and had a very prosperous society.",
"So they were like your kind?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Like the Altmer? Yes, I would say their culture quite possibly          rivaled our own.",
"What drove them underground?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           The Nords went to war with the Falmer in the First Era. Killed them           by the thousands to drive them from their snowy homeland. The Falmer           retreated underground and forged an uneasy alliance with the           dwarves, who ended up betraying them. This betrayal made them what           they are now...horrible, blind monstrosities with a burning hatred           of any but their own kind.",
"They sound more like victims to me.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Yes, I suppose you're right. Forgive me. I've lost several close            friends to the Falmer and it tends to distort my view.",
"You appear to despise them.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Why shouldn't I? The Falmer have killed more than a fair share of            my acquaintances. They're animals...they show absolutely no pity            or remorse.",
"Then I'll make it a point to hunt them down.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Good. I lost more than a few acquaintances to the Falmer and I wish            to see them avenged.",
"If you wish to learn more about them, you're welcome to my tome on           the subject. Should be on my table.",
"What can you tell me about Gallus?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         He was a dear friend of mine and a surprisingly astute pupil of         academia...I was devastated when he was killed. I suppose that risk         always coexisted with his line of work; I just never thought his luck         would run out.",
"He was an academic yet he chose a different path. Why?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Well, for the thrill, of course. He was quite clear that he felt more          in his element climbing through a window than hunched over a dusty          tome.",
"How did you meet him?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Ah, yes, quite an amusing anecdote actually. I caught him trying to           break into my laboratory. I was about to show him the error of his           ways when he made a curiously astute comment about my research           notes. I was astounded and it in turn lead to a conversation. Who'd           have imagined it would lead to such a strong friendship?",
"Why did Gallus scribe his journal in Falmer?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Besides the fact that there are only a handful of people in Tamriel         that even recognize the language? I'm fairly certain he was planning         some sort of a heist that involved a deep understanding of the Falmer         language. Sadly, we never had the opportunity to speak about the         details.",
"Where did he acquire the knowledge to use it?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Ironically, I pointed him in the same direction I pointed you, to          Markarth and Calcelmo. I'm only hoping whatever means he used to          learn the language will still be available to you.",
"Calcelmo is stubborn as a mule. Be careful when you speak to him.",
"Calcelmo: Look, I'm very busy, so this better be important. What are you doing          here? The excavation site is closed. I don't need any more workers or          guards.",
"Dragonborn: I was looking for you, actually.",
"Calcelmo: I told you I'm not hiring any more guards. Why do you people always          bother me when I'm trying to finish my research? You idiot. Do you          even know who I am? The most recognized scholar on the Dwemer in all          of Tamriel, and you people keep bothering me! I...I'm sorry, I...I          got too excited. I'm in the middle of some very...stressful work,          and I shouldn't have yelled. How can I help you?",
"Dragonborn: I hear you're the authority on ancient Falmer.",
"Calcelmo: Then you were well informed. I am at this very moment on the cusp of          completing my magnum opus on the subject. I'm calling it 'Calcelmo's          Guide to the Falmer Tongue'. It will revolutionize the way we          understand those ancient beings.",
"Dragonborn: Perhaps I could view your work?",
"Calcelmo: Preposterous! That research represents years of personal toil in some          of the most dangerous Dwemer ruins in Skyrim! You must be mad to          think I'd allow anyone to see it before it's completed.",
"Even after everything I did for you and Faleen?²          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Well, I'm not blind to the fact that you've been instrumental in           improving my affairs of the heart. If you wish, you may enter my           tower to view the museum section, but I'm afraid the laboratories           are still off-limits. That's the best I can offer.",
"But I'm a great admirer of your work. (Persuade)",
"What will it cost to change your mind? (Bribe)          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I'm not certain how many scholars you're accustomed to dealing with,           but I can assure you personal wealth is our lowest priority.",
"Grant me access or you'll regret it. (Intimidate)          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Do you realize that at the snap of my finger, I can bring the entire           Markarth city guard to my defense? You best rethink this course of           action or you may find yourself on the executioner's block.",
"Forget it. Maybe I'll come back later.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Very well. Perhaps when my research is complete, I'll feel more           comfortable discussing my findings with you.",
"Aicantar: You heard me, captain -- our work must not be disturbed. Kill any          intruders on sight. Call for backup if you need it. But let no one          through.",
"Wizards' Guard: ...As you say, sir.",
"Aicantar: Yes, I'm positive I heard something!",
"Captain Aquilius: I...oh, alright. If there is a thief, he won't leave this                  tower alive. But shouldn't we inform Master Calcelmo?",
"Aicantar: I'll deal with my uncle. Just...go! Scour this place from top to          bottom!",
"Enthir: Back, eh? And how was our friend Calcelmo?",
"Dragonborn: This should help translate Gallus' journal.",
"Enthir: I suppose it would be inappropriate of me to ask how you obtained this,        so I simply won't. A rubbing, eh? Odd. I expected notes.",
"Dragonborn: It's quite the tale.",
"Enthir: I undertstand¹. Now, let me take a good look at this. Over here,        please. Hmm... This is intriguing, but highly disturbing. It appears        Gallus had suspicions about Mercer Frey's allegiance to the Guild for        months. Gallus had begun to uncover what he calls an '...unduly lavish        lifestyle replete with spending vast amounts of gold on personal        pleasures.'",
"Karliah: Does the journal say where this wealth came from?",
"Enthir: Yes. Gallus seems certain that Mercer had been removing funds from the        Guild's treasury without anyone's knowledge.",
"Karliah: Anything else, Enthir? Anything about...the Nightingales?",
"Enthir: Hmm. Yes, here it is. The last few pages seem to describe 'the failure        of the Nightingales,' although it doesn't go into great detail. Gallus        also repeatedly mentions his strong belief that Mercer desecrated        something known as the Twilight Sepulcher.",
"Karliah: Shadows preserve us. So it's true...",
"Enthir: I'm not familiar with the Twilight Sepulcher. What is it? What's Mercer        Frey done?",
"Karliah: I'm sorry, Enthir. I can't say. All that matters is we deliver your         translation to the Guild immediately. Farewell, Enthir...words can't         express...",
"Enthir: It's alright, Karliah. You don't have to say a word. Listen, all I want        is the truth to be revealed to the Guild. They respected Karliah, and        she deserves better. Do whatever you can and I'll consider it a        personal favor.",
"Dragonborn: Thank you, Enthir.",
"Enthir: If you ever manage to gain entry to the College, and you find trying to        rid yourself of stolen goods becoming a burden, come visit me. I've        been known to handle items of questionable interest from time to time        and I'll see what I can do.",
"Karliah: You must hasten to Riften before Mercer can do any more damage to the         Guild.",
"Dragonborn: Gallus' journal mentioned the 'Twilight Sepulcher'.",
"Karliah: You've come this far, so I see no harm in concealing it any longer.         The Twilight Sepulcher is the temple to Nocturnal. It's what the         Nightingales are sworn to protect at all costs.",
"Dragonborn: Why does it require that type of protection?",
"Karliah: Everything that represents Nocturnal's influence is contained within         the walls of the Sepulcher. Now it seems Mercer's broken his oath         with Nocturnal and defiled the very thing he swore to protect.",
"Dragonborn: Thieves and temples. It just doesn't add up.",
"Karliah: I felt the same way when Gallus first revealed these things to me. I         think given time, you'll understand what I mean.",
"Dragonborn: I'd understand better if less mystery was involved.",
"Karliah: As a Nightingale, I've been sworn to secrecy regarding the Sepulcher.         I know the Guild doesn't do much to foster faith, but I'm going to         have to ask that you continue to trust me.",
"Dragonborn: Very well, we do it your way for now.",
"Karliah: I'll make for Riften and scout the situation; see if I can discover         what Mercer's up to. When you're ready, meet me at the Ragged Flagon.         In the meantime, I wanted you to have this. It belonged to Gallus, but         given the circumstances I think he'd approve.",
"Dragonborn: I'll put it to good use.",
"Karliah: If the Guild isn't willing to listen to reason, you might have to.",
"Karliah: I'm glad you're here. I think some of these people are beginning to         suspect who I am. Are you ready to face the Guild?",
"What if Mercer's there?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Then we'll show them Gallus' journal and hope for the best. Remember,          we've got proof and all he's got is his word.",
"No, I'm not.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Time is of the essence here, please hurry back.",
"Garthar: They're waiting for you in the cistern. No tricks.",
"Brynjolf: You better have a damn good reason to be here with that murderer.",
"Karliah: Please, lower your weapons so we can speak. I have proof that you've         all bee misled!",
"Brynjolf: No tricks, Karliah, or I'll cut you down where you stand. Now what's          this so-called proof you speak of?",
"Karliah: I have Gallus' journal. I think you'll find its contents disturbing.",
"Brynjolf: Let me see. No, it...it can't be. This can't be true. I've known          Mercer too long...",
"Karliah: It's true, Brynjolf. Every word. Mercer's been stealing from the Guild         for years, right under your noses.",
"Brynjolf: There's only one way to find out if what the lass says is true.          Delvin, I'll need you to open the Vault.",
"Delvin: Wait just a blessed moment, Bryn. What's in that book? What did it say?",
"Brynjolf: It says Mercer's been stealing from our vault for years. Gallus was          looking into it before he was murdered.",
"Delvin: How could Mercer open up a vault that needs two keys? It's impossible.        Could he pick his way in?",
"Vex: That door has the best puzzle locks money can buy. There's no way it can     be picked open.",
"Karliah: He didn't need to pick the lock.",
"Delvin: What's she on about?",
"Brynjolf: Use your key on the vault, Delvin. We'll open it up and find out the          truth.",
"Delvin: I've used my key, but the vault's still locked up tighter than a drum.        Now use yours.",
"Brynjolf: By the Eight! It's gone, everything's gone! Get in here, all of you!",
"Delvin: The gold, the jewels...it's all gone.",
"Vex: That son of a bitch! I'll kill him!",
"Brynjolf: Vex! Put it away...right now. We can't afford to lose our heads...we          need to calm down and focus.",
"Delvin: Do what he says, Vex. This ain't helpin' right now.",
"Vex: Fine. We do it your way. For now.",
"Brynjolf: Delvin, Vex...watch the Flagon. If you see Mercer, come tell me          right away.",
"Delvin: This is gettin' dangerous. Don't let anythin' get the jump on you.Delvin: Stabbed in the back. It's like the Dark Brotherhood all over again.",
"Vex: If I see Frey, I'll pluck his eyes from his skull with my bare hands!Vex: Need to stay focused in case Frey comes back, make it fast.",
"Rune: How can Karliah remain so calm when Mercer had her on the run for that      long? Amazing.",
"Cynric: I never saw this coming. I thought we were just having a run of bad        luck.",
"Ravyn Imyan: Vex is ready to tear you apart. I hope you have a good excuse for             bringing Karliah here.",
"Niruin: Vex better leave a piece of Mercer for us. It's payback time.",
"Garthar: If I find Mercer first, I'm going to crush his skull with my bare         hands!",
"Thrynn: I won't rest until Mercer's dead. How could he murder Gallus and betray        all of us like that?",
"Sapphire: I dare Mercer to come back here! He takes one step in the cistern          and I'll cut it off!",
"Vipir the Fleet: I can't believe he emptied the vault. Right from under our                 noses.",
"Tonilia: There's no doubt Mercer will make for the borders of Skyrim. I hope         you find him before he escapes our grasp. If you find Mercer, give no         quarter...kill him and be done with it.",
"Vekel the Man: Word is Mercer Frey is a dead man. The Guild wants his blood. I               can't say I blame them. Murder is not our way. Gallus was before               my time, but I still can't believe it. You need to teach him a               lesson...show him the penalty for betrayal around here.",
"Brynjolf: Look, before I help you track Mercer down, I need to know what you          learned from Karliah. I mean everything.",
"Mercer killed Gallus, not Karliah.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Aye, I feared that was the case. From that last entry in Gallus's           diary, it looks like he was getting close to exposing Mercer to the           Guild. Anything else?",
"Gallus, Karliah and Mercer were Nightingales.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           What? Nightingales? But, I always just assumed they were a tale...           a way to keep the young footpads in line. Was there anything else           she told you?",
"Karliah was behind Goldenglow and Honningbrew.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Trying to make Mercer look bad in front of Maven, eh? Clever lass.           Was there anything else?",
"No, that's it.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Then, I have an important task for you. I need you to break into           Mercer's home and search for anything that tells us where he could           have gone.",
"Dragonborn: He has a house in Riften?",
"Brynjolf: Aye, a gift from the Black-Briars when the kicked the previous family          out...place called Riftweald Manor. He never stays there, just pays          for the upkeep on it. Hired some lout by the name of Vald to guard          the place.",
"Dragonborn: I'll take care of it.",
"Brynjolf: Be careful, lad. This is the last place in Skyrim I'd ever want to          send you. Just find a way in, get the information and leave. And you          have permission to kill anyone who stands in your way.",
"What's the best way to get into Riftweald Manor?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Good question. I've only set foot inside a few times myself and           that was in Mercer's company. If you can get past his trained           watchdog, I think your best bet might be the ramp to the second           floor balcony in his backyard.",
"What's missing from the vault?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Better question would be 'what did he leave.' Mercer took           everything. Even all of our plans are gone.",
"Plans for what?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Before Mercer took over, Gallus started collecting every bit of            material on locations the Guild could heist. Museums, keeps,            estates...you name it. By the time Mercer took over the Guild we            must have had a few dozen.",
"How could he have opened the vault door alone?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             I don't have a clue. That door is impenetrable. Without two keys,             it's impossible to open. I have a key, Delvin has a key, and             Mercer has a key. That's it. There are no other copies.",
"You mentioned a watchdog?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           That'd be Vald. A real piece of work, that one. Mercer's holding           something over his head, keeping him loyal. Talk to Vex. She used           to know him very well...if you catch my meaning.",
"Careful at Mercer's place, I don't want to lose anyone else to that          madman.",
"Dragonborn: Brynjolf said you have info on Vald.",
"Vex: That pig? Oh, I have info on him. More than you care to know.",
"Dragonborn: I want to get on his good side.",
"Vex: Vald? Good side? I think you have the wrong person. The only thing Vald     understands is gold. A man after my own heart.",
"Dragonborn: So, buy him off?",
"Vex: Sure, but he'll ask for a whole lot. I mean, you are asking him to betray     Mercer Frey. Your best bet would be to erase his debt with Maven     Black-Briar. If you talk to her, she might be able to give you the     details. Of course, you could just run him through and take what you need     off his corpse...I could care less. While you're in there, help yourself     to anything in Frey's manor. I would.",
"Vald: This is Mercer Frey's place and he don't like visitors. Now go away.",
"Dragonborn: I need to get inside Mercer's house.",
"Vald: No visitors. No way. Now piss off before ya make me mad.",
"Mercer needs you in Markarth right away! (Persuade)      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Oh, come on, I ain't that dumb.",
"Let me in or I'll kill you. (Intimidate)      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Hahaha! That's funny. Ya think you can take me on? Try it anytime. I've       been itching for a fight.",
"Dragonborn: I'd like to erase Vald's debt.",
"Maven: Vald? Why would you want to help that idiot? He owes me a steep debt.       In fact, he's lucky all I did was force him to work for Mercer.",
"Dragonborn: What did he do?",
"Maven: A few years back, I commissioned a unique quill from a good friend of       mine in Winterhold. Vald was tasked with getting it here safely and it       ended up at the bottom of Lake Honrich.",
"Dragonborn: He's in debt because of a quill?",
"Maven: The wizards call it the Quill of Gemination and demanded a tremendous       amount of gold to have it made. If you can locate the quill and return       it to me, something Vald was too stupid to do himself, I'll consider       the debt satisfied.",
"What is the Quill of Gemination?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        The quill was supposed to allow me to duplicate any writing I'm viewing        in exacting detail. I'm sure you understand how useful that would        prove in a business situation, especially where signatures were        involved.",
"What if someone else got their hands on it?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Fortunately, the quill required an ink with a unique formula known         only to myself. So if you're getting any ideas abou selling it to         someone else or keeping it, you'll find it would hold little value.",
"How did it end up in Lake Honrich?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        I had Vald meet the caravan from Winterhold on the western end of the        lake so he could avoid the roads. The idiot got lost in the mist and        ran his boat right over some rocks, sending it straight to the bottom.        He's too stupid to remember where he was, and any attempt I've made to        find it in the past has been unsuccessful.",
"Any ideas where I can look?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Vald said his rowboat struck some rocks...I'd check under the water         near one of the small islands in the lake. Perhaps you should start         at the docks and work your way out towards Goldenglow Estate.",
"Dragonborn: I found the Quill of Gemination.",
"Maven: Really? I wrote that off a long time ago. Well, I suppose I need to       fulfill my end of the bargain. Give this document to Vald. It frees him       from the debt, but I never want to see him in Riften again.",
"Dragonborn: I have something of yours.",
"Vald: Of mine? What is it?",
"Dragonborn: Here, it's your debt with Maven. You're free.",
"Vald: I can't believe it! How'd ya talk her into this? Never mind, I don't      care. I'm just glad I don't gotta work for Maven anymore. Here, ya did      me a favor, I guess I owe you one.",
"Brynjolf: I've scoured the town and I've spoken to every contact we have left.          No sign of Mercer. Any luck on your end?",
"Dragonborn: He wasn't here, but I found these plans.",
"Brynjolf: Shor's beard! He's going after the Eyes of the Falmer? That was          Gallus's pet project. If he gets his hands on them, you can be          certain he'll be gone for good and set up for life.",
"Dragonborn: Then we have to stop him.",
"Brynjolf: Agreed. He's taken everything the Guild has left, and to go after          one of the last greatest heists is just an insult. I've spoken to          Karliah, and made amends for how the Guild's treated her. Now she          wishes to speak with both of us. Quickly, we have no time to lose.",
"Karliah: Brynjolf, the time has come to decide Mercer's fate. Until a new         Guild Master is chosen, the decision falls to you.",
"Brynjolf: Aye, lass...and I've come to a decision. Mercer Frey tried to kill          both of you, he betrayed the Guild, murdered Gallus and made us          question our future. He needs to die.",
"Karliah: We have to be very careful, Brynjolf. Mercer is a Nightingale, an         Agent of Nocturnal.",
"Brynjolf: Then it's all true...everything I heard in the stories. The          Nightingales, their allegiance to Nocturnal and the Twilight          Sepulcher.",
"Karliah: Yes. That is why we need to prepare ourselves and meet Mercer on         equal footing. Just outside of Riften, beyond the Southeast Gate, is         a small path cut up the mountainside. At the end of that path is a         clearing and an old standing stone. I'd ask you both to meet me         there.",
"Karliah: I'm glad you're here.",
"Dragonborn: What's the significance of this place?",
"Karliah: This is the headquarters of the Nightingales, cut into the         mountainside by the first of our kind. We've come to seek the edge we         need to defeat Mercer Frey.",
"Dragonborn: What kind of an edge?",
"Karliah: If you'll follow me, I'll try to explain on the way.",
"Tell me about the Nightingales.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Gallus, Mercer Frey and I were once members of what is known as the          Nightingale Trinity. The Trinity disbanded twenty-five years ago when          Mercer Frey betrayed us by slaying Gallus and dumping his body in the          ruins of Snow Veil Sanctum.",
"Were they a part of the Thieves Guild?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Indirectly. The Trinity is usually selected from the ranks of the           Guild, although its existence is a closely-guarded secret.",
"What is their purpose?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            The Nightingales protect the Temple of Nocturnal, a place known as            the Twilight Sepulcher.",
"Who is Nocturnal?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          She's the mistress of night and darkness and the patron of every          thief in Tamriel.",
"Sounds like a Guild contract.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            You're closer to understanding than you realize. The only            difference is she doesn't demand payment in the traditional sense,            and sometimes the cost can be quite high. Whether you know it or            not, Nocturnal dictates how well we perform as rogues.",
"Sounds like she just likes us to suffer.             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              Nocturnal's whim is the greatest mystery to everyone. There have              been volumes written on the subject. Does she exact payment when              we die? When we suffer does she revel in our misery? No one              knows. The return certainly seems worth the risk though.",
"Am I to become a Nightingale?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          It's my hope that you will, yes.",
"What happened to capturing Mercer alive?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          From the moment you were struck with my poisoned arrow at Snow Veil          Sanctum, my path changed its course. Perhaps I couldn't bring Mercer          back alive, but together, we were able to clear my name and to put          Gallus's remains to rest. I'd always intended Mercer's fate to          ultimately be decided by the Guild, and it seems they've spoken.",
"This way, please.",
"Brynjolf: So, this is Nightingale Hall. I heard about this place when I joined          the Guild, but I never believed it existed.",
"Karliah: The assumption that the Nightingales were just a myth was seeded         within the Guild on purpose. It helped avert attention from our true         nature. What's wrong, Brynjolf? I can almost hear your brow furrowing.",
"Brynjolf: I'm trying to understand why I'm here, lass. I'm no priest, and I'm          certainly not religious. Why pick me?",
"Karliah: This isn't about religion, Brynjolf...it's business. This is         Nightingale Hall. You're the first of the uninitiated to set foot         inside in over a century. Now, if you'll both proceed to the armory         to don your Nightingale Armor, we can begin the Oath.",
"Brynjolf: I think we should trust the lass and take the deal.",
"Karliah: You appear ready for the Oath.",
"Brynjolf: Okay, lass. We've got these getups on...now what?",
"Karliah: Beyond this gate is the first step to becoming a Nightingale.",
"Brynjolf: Whoa there, lass. I appreciate the armor, but becoming a Nightingale?          That was never discussed.",
"Karliah: To hold any hope of defeating Mercer, we must have Nocturnal at our         backs. If she is to accept you as one of her own, an arrangement must         be struck.",
"Brynjolf: What sort of arrangement? I need to know the terms.",
"Karliah: The terms are quite simple, Brynjolf. Nocturnal will allow you to         become a Nightingale and use your abilities for whatever you wish.         And in return, both in life and death, you must serve as a guardian         of the Twilight Sepulcher.",
"Brynjolf: Aye, there's always a catch. But at this point, I suppose there isn't          much to lose. If it means the end of Mercer Frey, you can count me          in.",
"Karliah: What about you? Are you ready to transact the Oath with Nocturnal?",
"Yes, I'm ready.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Good. After I open the gate, please stand on the western circle.",
"And in return?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           In return, you'll be required to defend the Twilight Sepulcher and           everything within when the need arises. More importantly, upon your           death, your spirit will be bound to the Twilight Sepulcher as one           of its guardians.",
"There's no going back?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Once the Oath has been struck, the terms are binding. Knowing this,            are you ready to undergo the ceremony?",
"Karliah: I call upon you, Lady Nocturnal, Queen of Murk and Empress of Shadow.         Hear my voice!",
"Nocturnal: Ah, Karliah. I was wondering when I'd hear from you again. Lose           something, did we?",
"Karliah: My lady, I come before you to throw myself at your mercy and to accept         responsibility for my failure.",
"Nocturnal: You're already mine, Karliah. Your terms were struck long ago. What           could you possibly offer me now?",
"Karliah: I have two others that wish to transact the Oath; to serve you both in         life and in death.",
"Nocturnal: You surprise me, Karliah. This offer is definitely weighted in my           favor.",
"Karliah: My appetite for Mercer's demise exceeds my craving for wealth, Your         Grace.",
"Nocturnal: Revenge? How interesting... Very well, your conditions are           acceptable. You may proceed.",
"Karliah: Lady Nocturnal, we accept your terms. We dedicate ourselves to you as         both your avengers and your sentinels. We will honor our agreement in         this life and in the next until your conditions have been met.",
"Nocturnal: Very well. I name your initiates Nightingale and I restore your           status to the same, Karliah. And in the future, I'd suggest you           refrain from disappointing me again.",
"Karliah: Now that you've transacted the Oath, it's time to reveal the final         piece of the puzzle to you; Mercer's true crime.",
"Dragonborn: He's done more?",
"Karliah: Mercer was unable to unlock the Guild's vault without two keys because         of what he stole from the Twilight Sepulcher...the Skeleton Key. By         doing this, he's compromised our ties to Nocturnal, and in essence,         caused our luck to run dry.",
"Dragonborn: So the key unlocks any door?",
"Karliah: Well, yes. But the key isn't only restricted to physical barriers. All         of us possess untapped abilities; the potential to wield greater         power, securely sealed within our minds. Once you realize the key can         access these traits, the potential becomes limitless.",
"The Guild should possess this item.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Although it would benefit the Guild more than you could imagine, in          the end, it would do more harm than good.",
"The three of us could keep it.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I'm afraid that's impossible.",
"Sounds like no one should possess it.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Good, then you understand why this is about more than Mercer's lust          for power.",
"If the Key isn't returned to its lock in the Twilight Sepulcher,         things will never be the same for the Guild. As time passed on, our         luck would diminish to the point of non-existence. And whether you         know it or not, our uncanny luck defines our trade.",
"Dragonborn: First time I ever set out to return something...",
"Karliah: Very true. In our line of work, it's quite rare we set out to return         a stolen item to its rightful owner.",
"Dragonborn: Let's go.",
"Karliah: Before we depart, Brynjolf has some business to discuss. I suggest you         listen to him.",
"Brynjolf: Listen, lad. There's one last piece of business we need to settle          before we go after Mercer...the leadership of the Guild.",
"Dragonborn: Why tell this to me?",
"Brynjolf: Karliah and I had a long discussion before you arrived here. Thanks          to your efforts, Mercer's treachery has been exposed. After we deal          with him, all that remains is restoring the Guild to its full          strength. As a result, we both feel that you have the potential of          replacing Mercer as leader of the Thieves Guild.",
"Dragonborn: Me? What about you?",
"Brynjolf: I've been at this game a long time, my friend. A long time. I've          stolen trinkets from nobles and framed priests for murder. I'm good          at what I do, maybe even one of the best. But it's all I know. I've          never been one to lead. Never desired it, never cared for it. Don't          want it.",
"It's about time you asked.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Ha! Spoken like the leader of the Thieves Guild. Just don't lose           yourself in the role. We have a bit of an errand to run before your           coronation.",
"No, it's not right.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Look. Everyone in the Guild admires what you've done. Maybe they           won't come out and simply tell you, but I promise you it's true.           And now they know Mercer never genuinely cared about the Guild. He           lacked the loyalty you obviously possess. I can't think of anyone           better.",
"Dragonborn: I accept.",
"Brynjolf: Then it's decided. When this is all over and Delvin's contacts assure          me we've regained our footing in Skyrim, we'll handle the details.          Until then, we have quite the task ahead.",
"Dragonborn: Then lets get to it.",
"Brynjolf: I've been pouring over the plans you brought us, and I'm convinced          the Eyes of the Falmer are in the dwarven ruins at Irkngthand.          Karliah and I will meet you there. Prepare yourself, lad. This will          be a fight to remember!",
"Do you think we stand a chance against Mercer?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           If you would have asked me that yesterday, I'd have said no. But now           I think our chances have improved. Look, call me crazy if you like,           but I trust Karliah. I don't think she'd lead us down a suicidal           path. Besides, I'd rather die with some of Mercers blood on my           blade than spend my life regretting that I ran the other way.",
"Dragonborn: I don't feel stronger.",
"Karliah: With the Skeleton Key missing from the Twilight Sepulcher, I'm afraid         afraid Mercer's seen to it that none of us can benefit from         Nocturnal's gifts.",
"Dragonborn: But she spoke to us.",
"Karliah: You merely transacted the Oath; signed the unwritten contract with         Nocturnal. In order for us to receive our abilities...our end of the         bargain, I'm afraid the Key must be returned.",
"Dragonborn: Then Nocturnal's angry at us?",
"Karliah: If Nocturnal was truly displeased with me...with any of us, she         wouldn't have answered my call. I have no doubt that we still hold         her favor and I believe it gives us enough of an edge to defeat         Mercer Frey.",
"Dragonborn: May I ever return to Nightingale Hall?",
"Karliah: Yes. Now that you're a Nightingale, you may consider this your new         home. You'll find that this place offers many things that will help         you in your endeavors as well as a wealth of information for you to         learn. Once the Skeleton Key has been restored to the Twilight         Sepulcher, I'll make this place my home as well.",
"Karliah: Mercer's been here...I hope we're not too late.",
"Dragonborn: Those bandits back there...",
"Karliah: Brynjolf and I found them like that. Mercer's doing. We have to catch         up to him before it's too late.",
"Dragonborn: I'm ready. Let's go.",
"Karliah: We should tread carefully. I wouldn't be surprised if he's left behind         a few surprises for us.",
"Brynjolf: Crime is one thing, murder is another. Mercer will answer for this.",
"Do you think Mercer knows we're here?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           The lass seems to think old Mercer is pulling a fast one on us...           leading us here and letting the dwarven constructs wear us down.           I've learned to trust her lead at this point. After all, we           Nightingales need to stick together, eh?",
"What are the Eyes of the Falmer?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           A few years before Mercer murdered Gallus, the Guild took in a           thief who specialized in dwarven antiquities. The thief had broken           into a nobleman's home somewhere in Windhelm and made off with a           small figurine of a snow elf with crystalline eyes.",
"So the Eyes of the Falmer are gems?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             Not just ordinary gems. They're said to be flawlessly cut and as             big as a man's head. Can you imagine how much they're worth?             Gallus and Mercer spent the better part of a month infiltrating             Irkngthand, but the dwarves had protected the place far too well.             There were just too many obstacles blocking the way. The plans             were shelved and the rest is history.",
"Karliah: If Mercer leaves here with the Eyes, we'll never see him again.",
"Do you think Mercer knows we're here?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Mercer's been careful so far. I don't think he'd just leave those          plans behind unless he had his reasons. For someone in possession          of the Skeleton Key, stealing the Eyes of the Falmer would be child's          play. No, he means to ambush us down here, I'm almost certain of it.",
"Both of you wait here a moment.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Alright, but don't wander ahead too far or else we'll be forced to          come find you.",
"Let's go.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Lead on, we're ready.",
"Keep as quiet as you can. The Falmer are blind but they can still hear         us.",
"Karliah: Wait a moment...what's that? It's Mercer! Look...down there!",
"Brynjolf: I'm on it, lass. Damn it! There's no way through.",
"Karliah: He's toying with us. He wants us to follow.",
"Brynjolf: Aye, lass...and we'll be ready for him. Let's keep moving.",
"Brynjolf: Look at the size of this place. Have you ever seen anything like it          in your life, lass?",
"Karliah: Can't say that I have. Imagine the riches hidden within these walls.",
"Brynjolf: Looks like we can take the low road or the high road across this          chamber. Your choice.",
"Brynjolf: So this is what we heard. The entire tower collapsed.",
"Karliah: The only reason to do that would be to block pursuit. It must be         Mercer. We'll have to find another way around.",
"Brynjolf: Shor' bones! Look at that monstrosity.",
"Karliah: It's a Dwarven Centurion. Very tough and very deadly.",
"Brynjolf: We can take the beast on or sneak around. It's your call, lad. We're          right behind you.",
"Karliah: This is where we saw Mercer. We must be getting close.",
"Karliah: Even the Falmer don't deserve the pain these implements must have         inflicted. The dwarves were a cruel race.",
"Karliah: There's a mass of the Falmer in this chamber. We can sneak through or         take them down...I don't care. As long as we get to Mercer.",
"Karliah: I can hear water rushing through these pipes. We must be beneath a         lake.",
"Karliah: He's close. I'm certain of it. We must prepare ourselves.",
"Brynjolf: Then this is it. We do this for Gallus and for the Guild.",
"Karliah: He's here and he hasn't seen us yet. Brynjolf, watch the door.",
"Brynjolf: Aye, lass. Nothing's getting by me.",
"Karliah: Climb down that ledge and see if you can--",
"Mercer: Karliah, when will you learn you can't get the drop on me?",
"Mercer: When Brynjolf brought you before me, I could feel a sudden shift in        the wind. And at that moment, I knew it would end with one of us at        the end of a blade.",
"Dragonborn: Give me the Key, Mercer.",
"Mercer: What's Karliah been filling your head with? Tales of thieves with        honor? Oaths rife with falsehoods and broken promises? Nocturnal        doesn't care about you, the Key or anything having to do with the        Guild.",
"It's not about Nocturnal. This is personal.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Revenge is it? Have you learned nothing from your time with us? When         will you open your eyes and realize how little my actions differ from         yours? Both of us life, cheat and steal to further our own end.",
"To blazes with Nocturnal. I'm here for the Eyes.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Wait a moment...do I detect a hint of genuine avarice from this noble         thief? Perhaps Karliah and Brynjolf misjudged you and your true nature         is no different than my own.",
"Dragonborn: The difference is I still have honor.",
"Mercer: It's clear you'll never see the Skeleton Key as I do...as an instrument        of limitless wealth. Instead you've chosen to fall over your own        foolish code.",
"Dragonborn: If anyone falls, it will be you.",
"Mercer: Then the die is cast, and once again my blade will taste Nightingale        blood! Karliah, I'll deal with you after I deal with your irksome        companions. In the meantime, perhaps you and Brynjolf should get better        acquainted.",
"Brynjolf: What...what's happening... I can't stop myself.",
"Karliah: Fight it, Brynjolf...he's taken control of you!",
"Brynjolf: I'm sorry, lass, I...I can't...!",
"Karliah: Damn you, Mercer!",
"Brynjolf: Enough of this! Fight me!",
"Mercer: Shadows take me...",
"Karliah: Damn! This place is coming down! Quick, get the Skeleton Key and the         Eye and lets¹ get out of here!",
"Brynjolf: No luck there, lass. Something must have fallen on the other side          of the door because it isn't moving!",
"Karliah: We have to find another way out of here before the place fills with         water!",
"Karliah: I can't believe it's over. After twenty-five years in exile and just         like that, it's done. All that remains is to ensure the safe return         of the Skeleton Key.",
"Dragonborn: Sounds like it will be a simple task.",
"Karliah: I'm afraid it's not that simple. When the Skeleton Key was stolen from         the Twilight Sepulcher, our access to the inner sanctum was removed.         The only way to bring it back will be through the Pilgrim's Path.",
"Dragonborn: I take it you never used the Pilgrim's Path.",
"Karliah: It wasn't created for the Nightingales. It was created to test those         who wished to serve Nocturnal in other ways. As a consequence, I have         no knowledge of what you'll be facing.",
"Dragonborn: Then we'd best get started.",
"Karliah: Brynjolf is needed back at the Thieves Guild to keep order while         you're away. And I...I can't bear to face Nocturnal after my failure         to protect the Key. I'm afraid you'll have to face the end of your         journey alone.",
"Dragonborn: Don't worry. I'll return the Key.",
"Karliah: Take this with you. I'm not certain if it will help within the walls         of the Sepulcher, but I certainly don't need it as much as you. I've         had this bow almost my entire life, and it's never let me down. I         hope it brings you the same luck.",
"What's the story with the Pilgrim's Path?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Even though Nocturnal doesn't desire worship in the traditional          sense, the Twilight Sepulcher propagated a small group of priests.          Of course, they'd never come into direct contact with Nocturnal but          they insisted they had her favor. As part of their 'duties,' the          priests created all sorts of baseless rituals and ceremonies, all on          Nocturnal's behalf.",
"This didn't interfere with the Nightingales?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           These priests weren't¹ threat to the Skeleton Key or the conduit to           Nocturnal's realm, so they were tolerated. One of the ceremonies           involved the Pilgrim's Path, a so-called 'test of worthiness'. If a           pilgrim was able to complete the path, it was said they would live           forever in twilight. What that means is anyone's guess.",
"Tell me about the conduit inside the Sepulcher.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          The conduit to Nocturnal's realm, the realm of Evergloam, has been          in Skyrim...well, longer than recorded history. The Twilight          Sepulcher was constructed around it by man and mer in order to shield          it from those who would exploit its power. It's through this conduit          that we're given Nocturnal's greatest gift, our luck. What she gains          in return is a complete mystery.",
"Dragonborn: I'd ask the same question of you.",
"Dragonborn: The last? What happened to the rest?",
"Dragonborn: How are you to blame?",
"Dragonborn: Wait a moment... You're Gallus!",
"Gallus: I haven't heard that name in a long time. How do you know of me?",
"Dragonborn: I have the Key.",
"Gallus: The Key! You have the Skeleton Key! I never thought I'd see it again.        And Mercer Frey?",
"Dragonborn: Dead.",
"Gallus: Then...it's over and my death wasn't in vain. I owe you a great deal,        Nightingale.",
"My only regret is that you had to undertake this task alone.",
"Dragonborn: Karliah helped me.",
"Gallus: Karliah...she's still alive? I feared she'd befallen the same fate,        ending up a victim of Mercer's betrayal.",
"Dragonborn: Then take the Key and right all the wrongs.",
"Gallus: Nothing would bring me more pride than to return the Key, but I'm        afraid it's impossible. From the moment I arrived here, I've felt        myself...well...dying.",
"Dragonborn: How can a spirit die?",
"Gallus: The Sepulcher isn't merely a temple or a vault to house the Key. Within        these walls is the Ebonmere...a conduit to Nocturnal's realm of        Evergloam. When Mercer stole the key, that conduit closed, severely        limiting our ties to her.",
"Dragonborn: Then I'll have to proceed alone.",
"Gallus: I'm afraid so. I'm weakening, and I can feel myself slipping away. The        years without restoration of my power have taken their toll. Whatever        damage has been caused can only be corrected by following the Pilgrim's        Path to the Ebonmere and replacing the Key.",
"How does the Ebonmere affect all of us?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         The Ebonmere is a conduit through which Nocturnal influences our         world. Not through magic or blessings, but purely through luck.",
"Luck is meaningless. What we do involves skill.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Yes, absolutely. Your skill is your own...don't let anyone ever tell          you otherwise. But Nocturnal, she influences our luck; nearly          imperceptible assistance we get when we ply our trade.",
"How's that changing the way things are?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Think about the Guild...about the state it was in when you began.           Think about all the little things you might have heard. A pick           breaking when it shouldn't have, the clouds in the nighttime sky           clearing at the wrong moment... Our access to those bits of luck           are what separates us from common bandits.",
"So with the Ebonmere closed, our luck's run dry?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Precisely. There are still a few who call Nocturnal 'Lady Luck'            and for good reason.",
"What will I face in the Pilgrim's Path?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I wish I could help you, but I've been a prisoner in this very chamber         for the last quarter century. The only possible help I've come across         are the remains of some poor fellow who was trying to follow in your         footsteps. Perhaps his journal can help?",
"What's wrong with the other Nightingale Sentinels?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         With the Ebonmere closed, and the sudden severance from the realm of         Evergloam, I fear they've undergone a drastic change. They're shadows         of their former selves. They no longer remember their true purpose or         their original identities.",
"Why aren't you like them?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          My spirit didn't manifest itself in the Sepulcher immediately, so          fortunately I wasn't present when the Ebonmere was sealed. However,          ever since that day, I've felt my power waning...slowly draining          away.",
"Can't you just take the Key?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Whatever is affecting the Nightingale Sentinels is starting to affect         me too. As I get closer to the Ebonmere I begin to feel myself         slipping away. Even right this moment, I feel strange...when I don't         think I should be feeling anything at all.",
"Good luck, Nightingale.",
"Nocturnal: My, my. What do we have here? It's been a number of years since I've           stepped foot on your world. Or perhaps it's been moments. One tends           to lose track. So...once again the Key has been stolen and a           'champion' returns it to the Sepulcher. Now that¹ Ebonmere has been           restored, you stand before me awaiting your accolades; a pat on           the head...a kiss on your cheek. What you fail to realize is your           actions were expected and represent nothing more than the           fulfillment of your agreement. Don't mistake my tone for           displeasure, after all, you've obediently performed your duties to           the letter. But we both know this has little to do with honor and           oaths and loyalty. It's about the reward; the prize. Fear not.           You'll have your trinkets, your desire for power, your hunger for           wealth. I bid you to drink deeply from the Ebonmere, mortal. For           this is where the Agent of Nocturnal is born. The Oath has been           struck, the die has been cast and your fate awaits you in the           Evergloam. Farewell, Nightingale. See to it the Key stays this time,           won't you?",
"Karliah: I'm glad you were able to bring the Key back safely. Nocturnal seemed         quite pleased with your efforts.",
"Dragonborn: Pleased? She sounded indifferent.",
"Karliah: I wouldn't take that to heart. It's her way. Think of her as a         scolding mother continually pushing you harder to be successful;         outwardly sounding angry but silently content. I assure you, had she         been displeased with you, we wouldn't be having this conversation.",
"Dragonborn: What's thi about becoming an Agent of Nocturnal?",
"Karliah: The circles at the base of the Ebonmere imbue you with powers         befitting a Nightingale Agent. The crescent moon represents the Agent         of Shadow, the half moon for the Agent of Subterfuge and the full moon         for the Agent of Strife.",
"Dragonborn: Why can't I be all three?",
"Karliah: This is Nocturnal's way of maintaining balance. If you ever feel the         need to change your abilities, you can return to the Sepulcher and         step onto a different circle. Be warned that once you've chosen, you         can't reselect for at least a day.",
"Dragonborn: So what now?",
"Karliah: Now, your life as a Nightingale begins. Should the need arise, you'll         be summoned to the Sepulcher in order to defend it.",
"Dragonborn: And you?",
"Karliah: The Guild has welcomed me back with open arms. I feel like a void in         my life has finally been filled. I only hope this isn't an ending to         things, but actually the beginning.",
"Dragonborn: The beginning of what?",
"Karliah: Why, perhaps the greatest crime spree Skyrim's ever known. There are         pockets brimming with coin and coffers overflowing with riches ripe         for the picking. We may be Nightingales, but in our hearts we're still         thieves and we're damn good at what we do.",
"Tell me about the Agent of Stealth.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          The Agent of Stealth is the master of remaining unseen. They are able          to manipulate the darkness and use it to their advantage. On moonlit          nights or in darkneed rooms, this agent literally becomes invisible.",
"Tell me about the Agent of Strife.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          This Agent of Strife can send forth a tendril of pure darkness into          the heart of another, causing great injury to them. At the same time,          this tether will bolster the agent's own life force, making him          stronger.",
"Tell me about the Agent of Subterfuge.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          The Agent of Subterfuge utilizes shadow to cloud the judgment of          those around him. By weaving the darkness to their will, this Agent          can manipulate others into fighting for the Nightingale for a limited          time.",
"Choose your path and your journey will be complete.",
"Gallus: Karliah?",
"Karliah: Gallus! I feared I would never see you again. I was afraid you'd         become like the others.",
"Gallus: If it were not for the actions of this Nightingale, your fears would        have come true. He honors us all.",
"Karliah: What will you do now, my love?",
"Gallus: Nocturnal calls me to the Evergloam. My contract has been fulfilled.",
"Karliah: Will I ever see you again?",
"Gallus: When your debt to Nocturnal has been paid, we'll embrace once again.",
"Karliah: Farewell, Gallus. Eyes open...walk with the shadows.",
"Gallus: Goodbye, Karliah.",
"Dragonborn: How will I know if I'm needed here?",
"Karliah: If this place is in danger ever again, the shadows will call. Should         the need arise, a portal connects the Sepulcher and Nightingale Hall.         Use it whenever you wish.",
"Dragonborn: Where will you be from now on?",
"Karliah: I've decided to make my home at Nightingale Hall. Since it's your home         as well, I hope to see you and Brynjolf there. Of course, I may visit         some of Skyrim's cities to 'acquire' things from time to time. Can't         afford to get rusty now, can we?",
"Dragonborn: Where did Gallus go?",
"Karliah: Gallus's oath has been paid. His actions have satisfied the terms. Now         his spirit becomes one with the Evergloam...the realm of perpetual         twilight and the cradle of shadow.",
"Dragonborn: So, he's gone?",
"Karliah: No, not gone...he's become one with the shadows. This is the greatest         honor a Nightingale can hope to achieve. In death, he's become part         of that which we use to live.",
"Dragonborn: They're a part of the darkness around us?",
"Karliah: Absolutely. When we say 'walk with the shadows,' we are asking those         Nightingales who have passed on to protect us. It's believed that they         are literally what guides our uncanny luck...by placing their hands in         ours. That's why the Ebonmere needed to be reopened. Without it,         there's no way Nocturnal was able to allow them through.",
"Brynjolf: It's good to see you in one piece, lad! I just wanted to give you a          proper thank you for everything you've done. The Guild is back on          its feet again and on its way to a prosperous future. What's become          of the Skeleton Key?",
"Dragonborn: It's been returned to the Sepulcher.",
"Brynjolf: That's it then. After all of those years helplessly watching the          Guild decline. But enough of that...I'm confident that with you in          charge, we'll soon have more gold than we could possibly spend.",
"Dragonborn: So, where will you be now?",
"Brynjolf: I'll be down here, trying to coordinate everything with Delvin and          Vex; to make sure the coin keeps flowing...and no one skims! If you          still feel like doing some jobs, I'm sure Delvin and Vex have more          than their fair share to give out. Either way, it's been a pleasure,          my friend. Here's to the future of the Guild. May it last another          thousand years!",
"Brynjolf: Well, my friend...the time's come to make it official. It's time to          become our Guild Master. Don't worry, I promise this will be short          and sweet. If you'll just meet us in the center of the cistern room,          we can begin.",
"Brynjolf: Look, I've never been good at these things, so I'm just going to keep          it short. Being Guild Master means more than just getting a cut of          all the loot, it's about being a leader and keeping this rabble in          order. With that in mind, I propose that the position of Guild Master          should be yours. Delvin?",
"Delvin: Agreed.",
"Brynjolf: Vex?",
"Vex: Sure, why not...",
"Brynjolf: Karliah?",
"Karliah: Absolutely.",
"Brynjolf: Everyone is in agreement, so all I can do now is name you Guild          Master and wish you good fortune and long life. Now everyone, get          back to work.",
"Brynjolf: You need anything, anything at all...don't hesitate to ask.",
"Delvin: So now the pupil is the master, eh? Good show!",
"Vex: I suppose you deserve it. Couldn't do any worse than Mercer anyway.",
"Karliah: I can't think of a better person for the job, Nightingale.",
"Maven: I suppose congratulations are in order. Now don't screw it up.",
"Tonilia: Here's to a long and prosperous future...may the Guild last another         hundred years.",
"Vipir the Fleet: I am at your service.",
"Cynric Endell: As long as you continue to make us all rich, I'm behind you.",
"Thrynn: So, now that you're Guild Master, how about drinks for all of us!",
"Sapphire: Well, looks like you're running the show now. Good luck.",
"Niruin: We're all rich thanks to you. Cheers!",
"Garthar: Glad to see they picked the right person for the job.",
"Ravyn Imyan: I promise to live up to your expectations.",
"Vekel the Man: I haven't seen so much celebrating in years. Mercer's dead, we               have a new Guild Master and things are finally looking up.               Business is booming, coin is flowing and everyone seems content               as things keep going our way. A new chapter in the Thieves Guild               is being written this day and we all owe it to you. Many thanks.",
"Dragonborn: About the secrecy of the Nightingales...",
"Karliah: I think by now, most within the Guild are well aware of what         transpired between Mercer Frey and ourselves. The notion that the         Nightingales are a fictive group has long since passed. If you wish         to wear your Nightingale Armor within the Guild, I'm certain that no         one would give it a second thought.",
"Dragonborn: How have things been now that Mercer's gone?",
"Karliah: I'm feeling a sense of inner peace...something I haven't felt in a         very long time. Instead of being clouded with thoughts of revenge and         retribution, I feel only serenity and fulfillment. Of course, I've         been also dabbling in my old pastimes as well. Take a look around, and         feel free to share the fruits of my labor.",
"Dragonborn: So that's it? There's nothing else to it?",
"Brynjolf: Well, that's it. Sorry if it isn't the ceremony you were hoping for,          but we're not exactly known for throwing our coin around. After we're          done here, head over to Tonilia and she'll set you up with your Guild          Master Armor. Oh, and one last thing. Here, I want you to take this.          It's sort of a tradition around here.",
"Dragonborn: How's the Guild doing?",
"Brynjolf: Take a good look around you! Have you ever seen the Guild in such a          prosperous state? With Mercer Frey gone and our influence spreading          across Skyrim, the Guild's earned a new level of respect it hasn't          seen in decades. I couldn't be more proud to be part of the Thieves          Guild, or its new Guild Master.                                                          ____________________________________________________________________________/ DLC QUESTS [DLCQ] |_¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯DAWNGUARD                                                                [DWNG]_______________________________________________________________________________¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯",
"Durak: You there. The Dawnguard is looking for anyone willing to fight against       the growing vampire menace. What do you say?",
"What's the Dawnguard?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        We're vampire hunters. We search out and destroy those bloodsucking        scum wherever we find them.",
"Vigilants? Dawnguard? What are you talking about?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         The Vigilants mostly hunt down daedra worshippers, which is why they         got torn to pieces when they went up against vampires. That's why our         leader Isran is reestablishing the Dawnguard. Real, serious vampire         hunters.",
"Killing vampires? Where do I sign up?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Ha. Isran's going to like you. He's up the hill in the fort. He'll        decide if you're Dawnguard material.",
"Sorry, I'm not interested.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        That's what everybody says, right up until they find their throat        being ripped out by a pack of hungry vampires. If you change your mind        and decide to join fight before it's too late, go talk to Isran up at        the fort.",
"Agmaer: Oh, hey there! You here to join the Dawnguard, too? Truth is, I'm a        little nervous. I've never done anything like this before. I hope you        don't mind if I walk up with you. Hey, uh, don't tell Isran I was        afraid to meet him by himself. Not the best first impression for a new        vampire hunter, I guess. You've probably killed lots of vampires, huh?        I'm sure Isran will sign you right up. Not sure he'll take me. I hope        so. That must be it. Fort Dawnguard... Wow. Bigger than I expected.",
"Agmaer: Where is everybody? This place looks almost deserted.",
"Agmaer: I guess this is it. Wish me luck.",
"Celann: New recruits? Hmm. Isran will decide if you've got what it takes. Go        on, he's right inside.",
"Isran: Why are you here, Tolan? The Vigilants and I were finished with each       other a long time ago.",
"Tolan: You know why I'm here. The Vigilants are under attack everywhere. The       vampires are much more dangerous than we believed.",
"Isran: And now you want to come running to safety with the Dawnguard, is that       it? I remember Keeper Carcette telling me repeatedly that Fort Dawnguard       is a crumbling ruin, not worth the expense and manpower to repair. And       now that you've stirred up the vampires against you, you come begging       for my protection?",
"Tolan: Isran, Carcette is dead. The Hall of the Vigilants...everyone...they're       all dead. You were right, we were wrong. Isn't that enough for you?",
"Isran: Yes, well...I never wanted any of this to happen. I tried to warn all       of you... I am sorry, you know.",
"Isran: So who are you? What do you want?",
"What can I do to help?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        I need someone out in the field, taking the fight to the damn vampires,        while we're getting the fort back in shape... Tolan was telling me        about some cave that the Vigilants were poking around in. Seemed to        think it was more related to these recent vampire attacks.",
"What's the Dawnguard?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        We hunt down and kill vampires. Haven't you been paying attention? In        the old days, the Dawnguard kept all of Skyrim safe from those        bloodsucking scum. Then people stopped taking the threat seriously,        the Dawnguard was disbanded, and the vampires came creeping back. Now        I'm trying to reestablish the Dawnguard. Take the fight to the vampires        for a change. I hope it isn't too late.",
"Isran: Tolan, tell him about, what was it, Dimhollow?",
"Tolan: Yes, that's it. Dimhollow Crypt. Brother Adalvald was sure it held some       long-lost vampire artifact of some kind. We didn't listen to him any       more than we did Isran. He was at the Hall when it was attacked...",
"Isran: That's good enough for me. Go see what the vampires were looking for in       this Dimhollow Crypt. With any luck, they'll still be there. Here, you       should take a crossbow. Good for taking out those fiends before they       get close. Feel free to poke around the fort and take what you need.       There isn't much yet, but you're welcome to anything you can use.",
"Tolan: I'll meet you at Dimhollow. It's the least I can do to avenge my fallen       comrades.",
"Isran: Tolan, I don't think that's a good idea. You Vigilants were never       trained for...",
"Tolan: I know what you think of us. You think we're soft, that we're cowards.       You think our deaths proved our weakness. Stendarr grant that you do not       have to face the same test and be found wanting. I'm going to Dimhollow       Crypt. Perhaps I can be of some small assistance to you.",
"Isran: You there, boy. Stop skulking in the shadows and step up here. What's       your name?",
"Agmaer: I'm, uh...my name is Agmaer, sir.",
"Isran: Do I look like a 'sir' to you, boy? I'm not a soldier, and you're not       joining the army.",
"Agmaer: Yes, si...Isran.",
"Isran: Didn't I tell you to step forward? Hmm... Farm boy, eh? What's your       weapon?",
"Agmaer: Uh, my weapon? I mostly just use my pa's axe, when wolves are attacking        the goats or soemthing.",
"Isran: 'My pa's axe,' Stendarr preserve us. Don't worry, I think we can make a       Dawnguard out of you. Here, take this crossbow and let's see how you       shoot.",
"Agmaer: Uh, crossbow? I've never...",
"Isran: Yes, a crossbow. Best thing for killing vampires. Just take a few shots       at those crates over there. Take a deep breath and let it out as you       fire. You need to concentrate, boy. Try it again. You'll get the hang       of it. That's it.",
"Celann: Isran found something for you to do, eh? I thought he'd like you. Good        luck!",
"Vampire: These Vigilants never know when to give up. I thought we'd taught         them enough of a lesson at their hall.",
"Fledgling: To come in here alone...a fool like all the rest of them.",
"Vampire: He fought well enough though. Jeron and Bresoth were no match for him.",
"Fledgling: Ha. Those two deserved what they got. Their arrogance had become           insufferable.",
"Vampire: All this talk is making me thirsty. Perhaps another Vigilant will         wander in soon.",
"Fledgling: I wish Lokil would hurry it up. I have half a mind to return to the           castle and tell Harkon what a fool he's entrusted this mission to.",
"Vampire: And I have half a mind to tell Lokil of your disloyalty.",
"Fledgling: You wouldn't dare. Now shut up and keep on watch.",
"Adalvald: I'll never tell you anything. My oath to Stendarr is stronger than          any suffering you can inflict on me.",
"Lokil: I believe you, Vigilant. And I don't think you even know what you've       found here. So go and meet your beloved Stendarr.",
"Vampire: Are you sure that was wise, Lokil? He still might have told us         something. We haven't gotten anywhere ourselves with...",
"Lokil: He knew nothing. He served his purpose by leading us to this place. Now       it is up to us to bring Harkon the prize. And we will not return without       it. Vingalmo and Orthjolf will make way for me after this.",
"Vampire: Yes, of course Lokil. Do not forget who brought you news of the         Vigilants' discovery.",
"Lokil: I never forget who my friends are. Or my enemies.",
"Serana: Unh...where is...who sent you here?",
"Who were you expecting?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • I was expecting someone...like me, at least.         • I was expecting someone from my family. I don't recognize you. Are           you one of my father's little acolytes?",
"Who's your father?²           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            He's a very powerful man. Or he was at one point. I'm surprised            another vampire hasn't heard of him.",
"No, a group called the 'Dawnguard' sent me here.²        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         That's not a name I know. And it doesn't sound like a name a group         of vampires would choose.",
"That's not your concern.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I think it is, actually. Why would someone who isn't...like me...come         all the way down here?",
"What do you mean, 'like you'?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         A...can't you tell just from looking at me? A vampire.",
"Are you a...        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Vampire, yes.",
"How did you know I was a vampire?²        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         You think I can't tell my own kind? I smelled you almost before my         eyes were open.",
"You're a vampire?²        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Can't you tell your own kind? I smelled you almost before my eyes were         open.",
"The Dawnguard would want me to kill you.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • Not fond of vampires, are they? Well look. Kill me, you've killed           one vampire. But if people are after me, there's something bigger           going on. I can help you find out what that is.",
"Why were you locked away like this?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         That's...complicated. And I'm not totally sure if I can trust you.         But if you want to know the whole story, help me get back to my         family's home.",
"Where do you need to go?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         ---",
"As long as you don't get in my way.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I was going to say the same thing to you.",
"My family used to live on an island to the west of Solitude. I would        guess they still do. By the way...my name is Serana. Good to meet you.",
"Dragonborn: Any idea how to get out of here?",
"Serana: Your guess is as good as mine. This place looks pretty different from        when I was locked away.",
"Dragonborn: Is that an Elder Scroll?",
"Serana: Yes, it is, and it's mine.",
"Why do you have an Elder Scroll?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         It's...complicated. I can't really talk about it. I'm sorry.",
"Is it fragile? Do we need to be careful with it?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Ha. Nothing can destroy an Elder Scroll. Worry more about protecting         your hide, and let me worry about my things.",
"Dragonborn: How long were you in there?",
"Serana: Good question. Hard to say. I...I can't really tell. I feel like it        was a long time. Who is Skyrim's High King?",
"That's actually a matter for debate.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Oh, wonderful. A war of succession. Good to know the world didn't get         boring while I was gone. Who are the contenders?",
"Ulfric Stormcloak is the true High King.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I've...never heard of him. Is he well supported?",
"Elisif of Solitude will be High Queen.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I don't know that name. You say she's Jarl of Solitude? Who supports         her?",
"Dragonborn: The Empire supports Elisif, but there are many in Skyrim loyal to            Ulfric.",
"Serana: Empire? What...what empire?",
"Dragonborn: The...Empire. From Cyrodiil.",
"Serana: Cyrodiil is the seat of an empire? I must have been gone longer than I        thought. Definitely longer than we planned. Please, let's hurry. I need        to get home so I can figure out what's happened.",
"Dragonborn: Why were you locked away?",
"Serana: I'd...rather not get into that with you. If that's all right. I'm        sorry, it's not that...it's just that I don't know who I can trust        just yet. Let's get to my home, and I'll have a better sense of where        we all stand.",
"Dragonborn: Tell me about your home.",
"Serana: It's on an island near Solitude. Hopefully we can find a boat to take        us there. It's my family home. Not the most welcoming place, but        depending on who's around, I'll be safe there.",
"Why wouldn't you be safe there?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Let's just say that my mother and father had a bit of a falling out.         Don't worry, I'm not in any danger or anything like that. It'll just         be more unpleasant to run into my father.",
"Someone you don't want to see?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         My father and I don't really get along. Ugh, saying it out loud makes         it sound so...common. 'Little girl who doesn't get along with her         father.' Read that story a hundred times.",
"Dragonborn: Wait here.",
"Serana: I'll hang back a bit, but you're not leaving me behind. This is too        important.Serana: Sorry, I'm not that easy to get rid of. If you want to run ahead, I        won't stop you, but I'll be following.Serana: If you think I'm going to let you have all the fun, you're crazy. I'll        let you lead ahead, but I'll be keeping an eye on you.",
"Dragonborn: Come with me.",
"Serana: Let's go.Serana: Thought you'd never ask.Serana: Whenever you're ready.",
"Dragonborn: I need to trade some things with you.",
"Serana: Hands to yourself.Serana: Not going to happen.Serana: Why don't you keep your things, and I'll keep mine.",
"Dragonborn: I think we should part ways.",
"Serana: I disagree.Serana: You can't get rid of me that easily.Serana: And go where? You can't just leave me alone whenever you feel like it.        I'm coming with you, like it or not.",
"Serana: This feels like the right way. I was starting to worry. Does the air        feel...heavy down here? I'm a little woozy, but it might just be from        waking up.",
"Serana: Ah, it's so good to breathe again! Even in this weather, it's better        than the cave.",
"Serana: I don't like the feel of this place. I'll wait for you back by the        entrance.",
"Isran: So, any luck? Was Tolan right about the vampires being interested in       Dimhollow Crypt?",
"Yes, the place was crawling with vampires.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Good. I assume you took care of that little infestation. Did you figure        out what they were looking for in there?",
"Tolan was right. And he's dead. The vampires killed him.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Damn fool. I told him not to go. The Vigilants always had more bravery        than sense. Did you at least find out what the vampires were looking        for in there?",
"Dragonborn: It seems they were looking for a woman who was sealed in the crypt.",
"Isran: That doesn't make much sense. Where is this woman? Who is she?",
"She didn't want to follow me here. But she wants me to take her home.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Home? Where's that?",
"She says she lives in a castle near Solitude.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Well I don't know what that means. But we need to find out. She must         either have something the vampires want, or be someone important to         them.",
"Serana: That's it, out there to the north. We used to keep a boat around here        to get there and back.",
"Dragonborn: So this is your home?",
"Serana: This is it. Home sweet...castle.",
"Why didn't you tell me it was so huge?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I didn't want you to think I was one of those...you know, the women         who just sit in their castle all day? I don't know. Coming from a         place like this, well...it's not really me. I hope you can believe         that.",
"It's impressive.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         It's something all right.",
"Serana: Hey, so...before we go in there...",
"What is it?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I wanted to thank you for getting me this far. But after we get in         there, I'm going to go my own way for a while. I think... I know your         friends would probably want to kill everything in there. I'm hoping         you can show some more control than that. Once we're inside, just         keep quiet for a bit. Let me take the lead.",
"Are you all right?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I think so. And thanks for asking. (repeats 'I wanted to thank...')",
"What is it now?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Fine, don't worry about it. When we get in, you won't have to babysit         about¹ me any more.",
"Watchman: Lady Serana's back! Open the gate!",
"Vingalmo: How dare you trespass here! Wait...Serana? Is that truly you? I          cannot believe my eyes! My lord! Everyone! Serana has returned!",
"Serana: I guess I'm expected",
"Lord Harkon: I can't believe it.",
"Harkon: My long-lost daughter returns at last. I trust you have my Elder        Scroll?",
"Serana: After all these years, that's the first thing you ask me? Yes, I have        the scroll.",
"Harkon: Of course I'm delighted to see you, my daughter. Must I really say the        words aloud? Ah, if only your traitor mother were here, I would let her        watch this reunion before putting her head on a spike. Now tell me, who        is this stranger you have brought into our hall?",
"Serana: This is my savior, the one who freed me.",
"Harkon: For my daughter's safe return, you have my gratitude. Tell me, what is        your name?",
"You first.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Very well.",
"You're vampires.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Not just vampires. We are among the oldest and most powerful vampires         in Skyrim.",
"You're a reclusive cannibal cult.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Not quite, though I can see how an outsider might arrive at that         conclusion. No, we are vampires, among the oldest and most powerful         in Skyrim.",
"For centuries we lived here, far from the cares of the world. All that        ended when my wife betrayed me and stole away that which I valued most.",
"Do I get a reward for finding your daughter?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I was about to suggest that very thing. Yes, you most certainly         deserve a reward.",
"What happens now?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         You have done me a great service, and now you must be rewarded.",
"There is but one gift I can give that is equal in value to the Elder        Scroll and my daughter. I offer you my blood. Take it, and you will        walk as a lion among sheep. Men will tremble at your approach, and you        will never fear death again.",
"And if I refuse your gift?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Then you will be prey, like all mortals. I will spare your life this         once, but you will be banished from this hall.",
"And if I want to remain a werewolf?²        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I will banish you from this castle. I will spare your life this once,         but after that, you are prey.",
"Perhaps you still need convincing? Behold the power!",
"Harkon: This is the power that I offer! Now, make your choice!",
"Harkon: Awake at last, good. The power is growing within you, and now you must        learn to wield it.",
"What happened? How did I get here?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         My blood is potent. At first, the body is overwhelmed by it. After my         bite, you collapsed and felt into a slumber. Now your flesh has         acclimated to the new blood that courses through your veins. I assure         you, no harm was done. In truth, your strength surprises me. Not all         mortals can withstand my embrace.",
"What is this place?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         A shrine to Molag Bal, the mighty Daedra Prince who is father to all         our kind. Our power is a blessing from him. It is he who first         bestowed the power of the ancient blood upon me.",
"You made a pact with Molag Bal?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          In an age long forgotten to history, I ruled as a mighty king. My          domain was vast, my riches endless and my power infinite. And yet,          as my mortal life neared an end, I faced a seemingly invincible          enemy -- my own mortality. I pledged myself to Molag Bal, and in his          name I sacrificed a thousand innocents. In reward, he gave          everlasting life to myself, my wife and my daughter. And so I have          defeated mortality itself.",
"Harkon: In this form, you can drain the life from your foes with your right        hand. With your left hand, you can wield the power of blood magic to        raise the dead. You can also call upon the powers of night to turn into        a swarm of bats and reappear some distance away. Should you run out of        magicka, you can descend to the ground and fight as the beasts do. Do        so now and we will continue.",
"Harkon: Good. You are weaker while on the ground, because you cannot access the        blood magic. However, the night powers are still yours to command, and        your claws are still formidable weapons. Over time, your powers will        grow in strength and you will find new ways to use your gifts. There        is much to learn, but if you master the powers of the Vampire Lord,        few enemies will be able to stand against you. There is one last thing        you must know. Slaying mortal men with your life drain grants you new        night powers and blood magic. I keep a stable of thralls in the castle        should you need to feed like the baser vampires to stave off the sun.        That is all I have to teach you. If you wish to be reminded of these        lessons, you need only ask. I have a task that will test your new        powers, but first, do you have any questions?",
"What must I know about being a vampire?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         As a vampire, you will gain new powers, but also a weakness to         sunlight. With each passing day that you do not feed, that weakness         will become more deadly, but your powers will also become stronger.         Feed upon those who are sleeping, and your vulnerability to sunlight         will diminish along with your powers.",
"Tell me again about being a Vampire Lord.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         When you first transform into a Vampire Lord, you will hover in the         air. While you do, you will command the powers of Blood and Night.         Descend to the ground, and you can attack with your claws and feed         upon your prey to regain your strength. With experience, your powers         will grow and you will discover new ways to use them.",
"Isran: Look at this. I should have known it was only a matter of time before       they found us. It's the price we pay for openly recruiting. We'll have       to step up our defenses. I don't suppose you have some good news for me.",
"Not exactly.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Damn. Well what do you know?",
"The woman was a vampire, and they wanted her back.²       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        And so we delivered her right to them. I should've kept her here until        we were certain...",
"The vampires were looking for a woman trapped in Dimhollow.²       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        A woman? Trapped in there? That doesn't make any sense. Who is she?        More importantly, where is she?",
"She wanted to go home, so I took her to her castle.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I'm waiting to hear what any of this means.",
"She's the daughter of a powerful vampire lord.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         And so you delivered her to them.",
"Dragonborn: They also have an Elder Scroll.",
"Isran: They what? And you didn't stop them? You didn't secure the scroll?",
"There were too many of them, and only one of me.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        So they have everything they wanted, and we're left with nothing.",
"By the Divines, this couldn't get much worse. This is more than you and       I can handle.",
"So you're just going to give up?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        When did I say that? We just need...we need help.",
"We have to do something.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Well of course we do. I'm old, not stupid. We're just going to need        some help.",
"If they're bold enough to attack us here, then this may be bigger than I       thought. I have good men here, but... There are people I've met and       worked with over the years. We need their skill, their talents, if we're       going to survive this. If you can find them, we might have a chance.",
"Dragonborn: Where can I find the people we need?",
"Isran: Right to the point, aren't you. I like that. Not like those fools in",
"Dragonborn: She'll help us?",
"Isran: Might need a little convincing first, but she should. You'll also want       to find Gunmar. Big brute of a Nord, hates vampires almost as much as I       do. Got into his head years back that his experience with animals would       help. Trolls in particular, from what I hear. Last I knew he was out       scouring Skyrim for more beasts to tame. Bring the two of them back       here, and we can get started on coming up with a plan. Watch your back.",
"Gunmar: • You there, hold fast! I've tracked this damned bear for two weeks;          I'll not let it have any more victims.",
"Dragonborn: Isran needs your help.",
"Gunmar: Isran? Needing someone else's help? Never thought I'd hear that. I'm        afraid he's a few years too late. I've moved on. I have more important        business to attend to. Besides, he can handle anything alone! He        assured me so himself. What could he possibly need my help with?",
"Dragonborn: We're up against vampires.",
"Gunmar: Vampires? That...well, that might change things. Tell me more about        what's going on.",
"Dragonborn: We're not sure, but they have an Elder Scroll.",
"Gunmar: By the Eight...",
"Dragonborn: Isran's at Fort Dawnguard.",
"He's been working on that place for years now. Never lets anyone in.          His own little fortress. Well, I guess I'll get to see what he's been          up to all this time. I'll meet you there.",
"Gunmar: Don't know how well I'd have managed by myself. You have my thanks.        You've helped me, so I suppose the least I can do is find out what        Isran wants. He's still at that fort near Stendarr's Beacon, I assume?",
"Yes, he said to meet him at Fort Dawnguard.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Of course he did.",
"How did you know?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         If Isran is anything, he's stubborn.",
"He's been working on that place for years now. Never lets anyone in.        His own little fortress. Well, I guess I'll get to see what he's been        up to all this time. I'll meet you there.",
"Sorine: You haven't seen a sack of dwarven gyros lying around, have you? I'd        swear I left it right here. Do you think mudcrabs might've taken it?        I saw one the other day... Wouldn't be surprised if it followed me        here. Just look around, will you?",
"Dragonborn: Isran asked me to find you.",
"Sorine: Isran? Wants me? No, you must be mistaken. He made it exceedingly clear        the last time we spoke that he had no interest in my help. I find it        hard to believe he changed his mind. He said some very hurtful things        to me before I left. Anyway, I'm quite happy with my current pursuits.        So if you'll excuse me...",
"You had a falling out?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Yes, that was my point. I felt it was rather clear. Look, what is it         you want from me?",
"Vampires threaten all of Skyrim. We need your help.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Vampires? Really? Oh, and I suppose now he remembers that I proposed         no less than three different scenarios that involved vampires         overrunning the population. Well, what are they up to?",
"They have an Elder Scroll.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I... Well, that's actually something I never would've anticipated.         Interesting. I'm not sure what they would want with one, but in this         case Isran is probably correct in thinking it isn't good.",
"We're not sure, but Isran is concerned.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         In case you haven't noticed, Isran is always concerned about         something. That's what got us working together in the first place.         Still, if he sent you to find me, it may actually be pretty bad.",
"All right. If nothing else, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to learn more        about what's going on so I can better defend myself. But I'm not just        going to abandon what I've been working on here. It's too useful. I        need at least one intact dwarven gyro. So either I need to find the        satchel those mudcrabs stole, or I need another gyro from someplace.        You wouldn't happen to have one, would you?",
"There's no time. You need to get moving now. (Persuade)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • Fine, fine! I can't afford to forget about this work, though. Some           very interesting applications. Now where is it I'm supposed to be           going?",
"Here, I've got a dwarven gyro. Take it.²        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Thank you! It's not much, but this will help a great deal with some         things I've been researching. Now where is it I'm supposed to be         going?",
"Dragonborn: We're meeting at Fort Dawnguard.",
"Sorine: Ah. Been working more on his secret hideout, has he? It'll be        interesting to see how much progress he's made. I'll finish up here and        head in that direction soon as I can. See you there.",
"Gunmar: All right Isran, you've got us all here. Now what do you want?",
"Isran: Hold it right there.",
"Sorine: What are you doing?",
"Isran: Making sure you're not vampires. Can't be too careful.",
"Isran: So, welcome to Fort Dawnguard. I'm sure you've heard a bit of what we're       up against. Powerful vampires, unlike anything we've seen before. And       they have an Elder Scroll. If anyone is going to stand in their way,       it's going to be us.",
"Sorine: This is all well and good, but do we actually know anything about what        they're doing? What do we do now?",
"Isran: We'll get to that. For now, get acquainted with the space. Sorine,       you'll find room to start your tinkering on that crossbow design you've       been working on. Gunmar, there's an area large enough for you to pen up       some trolls, get them armored up and ready to use.",
"Isran: In the meantime, we're going to get to the bottom of why a vampire       showed up here looking for you. Let's go have a little chat with it,       shall we?",
"Dragonborn: I have a message from Harkon.",
"Garan: Lord Harkon. Remember your place. Now, what is our Lord's wish?",
"Dragonborn: He simply said 'It is time.'",
"Garan: Well, well. He wants the Chalice, then. You've heard of the Bloodstone       Chalice?",
"Of course. Hasn't everyone?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        No. Don't try and impress me. It only leaves you looking foolish.",
"The Chalice has been in Lord Harkon's possession for quite some time       now. It is, when used properly, able to increase the potency of our       powers. He has neglected using it for ages. If he wants it filled now,       then grander things are afoot. This is good. Follow me. I'll take you       to it.",
"Garan: Lord Harkon has never cared to use the Chalice, relying on his more than       adequate powers until now. This is an intriguing change.",
"Garan: Excuse us. I need to fetch the Bloodstone Chalice.",
"Vingalmo: The Chalice? Why?",
"Orthjolf: What are you up to, Garan?",
"Garan: Lord Harkon's orders, Orthjolf. Calm yourself. Our friend here has been       ordered to fill the Chalice.",
"Vingalmo: Really?",
"Garan: Indeed. He's off to Redwater Den.",
"Orthjolf: Well, then... Best of luck to you.",
"Garan: Vingalmo and Orthjolf are Harkon's primary advisors. I'm sure they're       quite surprised to learn that you're taking the Chalice. And here we       are.",
"Garan: Now, this Chalice needs to be filled directly from the bloodspring       that is the source of Redwater Den. But that's not enough. Once that's       done, the blood of a powerful vampire needs to be added to it. Keep in       mind that Redwater Den has fallen into...well, let's just say less       reputable members of society now dwell there. It's your choice whether       to attempt to deal with them or force your way through. Hurry back. You       don't want to keep Lord Harkon waiting.",
"Doorman: Hold it. If you're going downstairs, you keep your weapons to yourself         or we'll be getting better acquainted. Head on in and behave yourself.",
"Thrall: So why don't you just drink the blood from the spring? I mean, that        seems easier than running a skooma den...",
"Vampire: The boss said it's some sort of profaned spring. It looks like blood,         but it's not the real thing. Drinking it gives you strength, but it         also gets you pretty messed up... That's why we thought of putting it         in the skooma.",
"Salonia Caelia: It's really too bad, you know. The little accident you had                here, completely unexpected...",
"Stalf: Yeah, too bad. Lord Harkon's new favorite, dead so soon after joining       the family.",
"Salonia: We're just lucky I was here to return the Chalice to Vingalmo, so he         could make sure Harkon gets it back.",
"Stalf: Wait, what? That's not what we agreed. We take it back together.",
"Salonia: Idiot. You didn't really think I'd let you walk out of here either,         did you? Vingalmo wants you both dead.",
"Stalf: Well, that's just fine. Orthjolf told me to finish off anyone who got       in the way.",
"Garan: I see you have returned. Lord Harkon will be pleased. You met Stalf and       Salonia, I assume? Lord Harkon and I suspected they might follow you       there.",
"They tried to kill me!       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Well of course they did.",
"Welcome to the politics of Lord Harkon's court. Vingalmo and Orthjolf       both long for our Lord's throne, but cannot make overt moves against       him. Each sought to gain power by using his underling to kill you and       keep the Chalice for himself. By ensuring the Chalice reaches our Lord,       you have increased his power over them, and at the same time deprived       them of their little pets. You've done Lord Harkon two great services.       Take what you've learned to heart, and be careful who you trust. Now, I       believe Lord Harkon wishes to speak with you.",
"Isran: This vampire showed up while you were away. I'm guessing it's the one       you found in Dimhollow Crypt. Says it's got something really important       to say to you. So let's hear it.",
"Serana: You probably weren't expecting to see me again.",
"Dragonborn: What are you doing here?",
"Serana: I'd rather not be here either, but I needed to talk to you. It's        important, so please just listen before your friend, here, loses his        patience. It's...well, it's about me. And the Elder Scroll that was        buried with me.",
"What about the scroll?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         The reason I had it...and why I was down there. It all comes back to         my father.",
"What about you?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         The reason I was down there...and why I had the Elder Scroll. It all         comes back to my father.",
"What sort of prophecy?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         It's pointless and vague, like all prophecies. The part he latched         onto said that vampires would no longer need to fear the sun. That's         what he's after. He wants to control the sun, have vampires control         the world.",
"What do you mean...'lost himself'?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         He just became absorbed...obsessed. It was kind of sick, actually.         The prophecy said that vampires would no longer need to fear the sun.         For someone who fancied himself as vampire royalty, that's pretty         seductive.",
"Anyway, my mother and I didn't feel like inviting a war with all of        Tamriel, so we tried to stop him. That's why I was sealed away with the        Scroll.",
"What's all this have to do with the Dawnguard?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I'm sorry, I had heard there were vampire hunters here. I thought         they might want to know about a vampire plot to enslave the rest of         the world. Was I wrong?",
"You took a big risk coming here.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I did. But something about you makes me think I can trust you. I hope         I'm not wrong.",
"No, you're right. We just have to convince the others you're on our        side. |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        ¯¯¯¯¯¯         Well, let's move then. I'm nothing if not persuasive.",
"You want us to help you?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         That was the plan, yes. Assuming the rest of them can trust a vampire.         Come on, I'll need you to help convince them.",
"Isran: All right, you've heard what it has to say. Now tell me, is there any       reason I shouldn't kill this bloodsucking fiend right now?",
"Because we're going to need her help.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Why, because of that story about the prophecy? About some vampire        trying to put the sun out? Do you actually believe any of that?",
"Why else would she risk her life to come here?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Who knows, maybe it has a death wish. Maybe it's just insane. I don't         really care.",
"Set your hatred aside and try to see the larger picture, Isran.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Set my hatred aside? Not a chance. It's what keeps me strong.",
"You don't trust her, fine. Trust me. I believe here.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         You'd better know what you're doing.",
"It can stay for now, but if it so much as lays a finger on anyone here,       I'll hold you responsible. Got it?",
"Isran: You hear me? Don't feel like a guest, because you're not. You're a       resource. You're an asset. In the meantime, don't make me regret my       sudden outburst of tolerance and generosity, because if you do, your       friend here is going to pay for it.",
"Serana: Thank you for your kindness. I'll remember it the next time I'm feeling        hungry. So, in case you didn't notice the giant thing I have on my        back, I have the Elder Scroll with me. Whatever it says, it will have        something that can help us. But of course, neither of us can read it.",
"Dragonborn: Who can?",
"Serana: Well, the Moth Priests are the only ones I've heard who can do it. They        spend years preparing before they start reading, though. Not that it        helps us, anyway, because they're half a continent away in Cyrodiil.",
"Isran: Some Imperial scholar arrived in Skyrim a few days ago. I was staking       out the road when I saw him pass by. Maybe that's your Moth Priest.",
"Serana: Do you know where he's staying now?",
"Isran: No, and I'm not going to waste men looking. We're fighting a war against       your kind, and I intend to win it. You want to find him, try talking to       anyone who'd meet a traveler. Innkeepers and carriage drivers in the big       cities maybe. But you're on your own.",
"Serana: Any idea on how you're going to find a Moth Priest? Skyrim's a pretty        big place.",
"Do you have any ideas?        Where would a Moth Priest actually go?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Well, back before I...you know. The College of Winterhold was the         first place I'd think to go for any kind of magic or historical thing.         The wizards know about all kinds of things that people probably         shouldn't know about.",
"Dragonborn: I need to find a Moth Priest.",
"Urag gro-Shub: A Moth Priest? What in Oblivion do you want a Moth Priest for?",
"Dragonborn: My business is my own. Just tell me what I need to know.",
"Urag: Fine, fine. No need to get your breeches in a twist. The obvious answer      is to go to the Imperial City. The Moth Priests make their home in the      White Gold Tower. Sometimes they go out looking for Elder Scrolls. Lucky      for you, there's a Moth Priest in Skyrim right now, doing just that. He      stopped in to do some research in the library, then left for Dragon      Bridge. If you hurry, you might catch him there.",
"Dragonborn: Have you seen a Moth Priest?",
"Driver: That's one of them Imperial scholars, right? Old man with a gray robe?",
"Dragonborn: That's right. You've seen him?",
"Driver: Might be that I have, but I can't say for sure. I got enough troubles        on my mind just tryin' to scrape by out here.",
"Please, it's very important that I find him. (Persuade)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • Now that I think on it, I did see your priest. He tried to hire me           for a trip to Dragon Bridge, but I told him that ain't one of my           stops.",
"Maybe this will put your mind at ease. (### gold)        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • Ah yes, I remember your Moth Priest now. He wanted me to take him           out to Dragon Bridge, but I told him it ain't one of my stops.",
"Never mind, I'll look somewhere else.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Suits me just fine.",
"Dragonborn: Heard anything about a moth priest passing through?",
"Corpulus: Have I heard anything? It was the talk of the city for three days          straight. Ain't too often we get a visitor like that.",
"Dragonborn: Where is he now?",
"Corpulus: Oh, he just left a short while ago. He said he'd finished up his          work and it was time to move on. That's all I can tell you. He asked          me not to let anyone know where he was going. I suppose he didn't          want the attention.",
"It's important that I find him right away. (Persuade)          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           • Ah, well, in that case, I'll tell you what I know. He took the             road southwest out of town, and he said he was going to be             crossing over the Dragon Bridge. That's all he told me. I hope it             helps.",
"Finding that Moth Priest is worth a lot to me. (### gold)          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           • I can see that. He said he was heading for Dragon Bridge next. I             hope that helps you.",
"Malkus: The more you fight me, the more you will suffer, mortal.",
"Dexion: I will resist you, monster. I must!",
"Malkus: How much longer can you keep this up, Moth Priest? Your mind was        strong, but you're exhausted from the struggle.",
"Dexion: Must... resist...",
"Malkus: Yes, I can feel your defenses crumbling. You want it to end. You want        to give in to me. Now, acknowledge me as your master!",
"Dexion: Yes. master¹.",
"Dexion: I serve my master's will. But my master is dead, and his enemies will        pay!",
"Dexion: Wait, stop! I yield! That...that wasn't me you were fighting. I could        see through my eyes, but I could not control my actions. Thank you for        breaking that foul vampire's hold over me.",
"Dragonborn: Are you alright?",
"Dexion: I'm quite alright, thanks to you. Dexion Evicus is my name. I'm a Moth        Priest of the White Gold Tower. These vampires claimed they had some        purpose in store for me, but they wouldn't say what. Probably holding        me for ransom, the fools.",
"Dragonborn: I know why they needed you, because we need you for the same            purpose.",
"Dexion: You do? Alright then, enough mysteries.",
"We're called the Dawnguard, and we need you to read an Elder Scroll.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         You have an Elder Scroll? Remarkable! If my knowledge of history         serves me, I recall that the Dawnguard was an ancient order of vampire         hunters. I will be happy to assist you with your Elder Scroll. Just         tell me where I need to go.",
"Dragonborn: You can find us at Fort Dawnguard, near Stendarr's Beacon.",
"Dexion: Very well. I'll hurry on my way there before more of those vampires        turn up.",
"Isran: I'm impressed you could find a Moth Priest so quickly.",
"Dragonborn: Does he have the Scroll? Is everything ready?",
"Isran: For the reading? Yeah. Just let the old man know when you're ready.",
"Dexion: Ah, hello there!",
"Dragonborn: Glad you made it here safely, Dexion.",
"Dexion: Ah, my rescuer! It's good to see you again.",
"Dragonborn: Have my companions made you feel welcome?",
"Dexion: It's not exactly the hospitality I'm used to, but your man Isran has        seen to my needs well enough. And might I add, this is a remarkable        fortress. I have colleagues back home that would love to study this        place in detail.",
"Dragonborn: Are you prepared to read the Elder Scroll?",
"Dexion: Oh, most certainly! Let's find out what secrets the scroll can tell.        Now, if everyone will please be quiet, I must concentrate.",
"Dexion: I see a vision before me, an image of a great bow. I know this weapon!        It is Auriel's Bow! Now a voice whispers, saying 'Among the night's        children, a dread lord will rise. In an age of strife, when dragons        return to the realm of men, darkness will mingle with light and the        night and day will be as one.' The voice fades and the words begin to        shimmer and distort. But wait, there is more here. The secret of the        bow's power is written elsewhere. I think there is more to the        prophecy, recorded in other scrolls. Yes, I see them now... One        contains the ancient secrets of the dragons, and the other speaks of        the potency of ancient blood. My vision darkens, and I see no more. To        know the complete prophecy, we must have the other two scrolls. I must        rest now. The reading has made me weary.",
"Isran: Come on, old man. You should get some rest.",
"Harkon: Ah, you are here. Good.",
"Dragonborn: You wanted to speak to me?",
"Harkon: Yes, I did. When I told you that I was grateful for my daughter's safe        return, I told the truth. But I did not tell you everything.",
"When do you plan to start trusting me?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Do not presume to tell me who I can and cannot trust. I possess the         wisdom of a dozen lifetimes, and I will make my own judgements. Now         be silent, and hear what I have to say.",
"As you know, vampires are powerful but we have limits. Our great enemy        is the sun, and until recently it's an enemy we've had no way to fight.        For centuries I searched for an answer to this problem. I found an old        prophecy written by a Moth Priest, those scholars who read the Elder        Scrolls. The prophecy tells of a time in which vampires will gain power        over the sun, and will no longer fear its tyranny. I believe the secret        to unraveling that prophecy is written in Serana's Elder Scroll. I have        ordered the court to assemble. I have a new task for us all to carry        out, and that includes you. Come now, and hear my proclamation.",
"Harkon: Scions of the night! Hear my words! The prophesied time is at last upon        us. Soon we will claim dominion over the sun itself, and forge a new        realm of eternal darkness. Now that I have reclaimed one of my Elder        Scrolls, we must find a Moth Priest to read it. I have spread false        rumors about the discovery of an Elder Scroll in Skyrim to lure a Moth        Priest here. Now it is time to see if those efforts have borne fruit.        Go forth, and search the land for rumors of a Moth Priest within our        borders. Look to the cities. Speak to the innkeepers, carriage drivers,        anyone who would meet a traveler. Go now, and carry out this task. This        is my command!",
"Ronthil: A Moth Priest?",
"Garan: It will be done my lord!",
"Vingalmo: Hm. Most intriguing.",
"Serana: Any idea on how you're going to find a Moth Priest? Skyrim's a pretty        big place.",
"Do you have any ideas?        Where would a Moth Priest actually go?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Well, back before I...you know. The College of Winterhold was the         first place I'd think to go for any kind of magic or historical thing.         The wizards know about all kinds of things that people probably         shouldn't know about.",
"Dawnguard Lieutenant: Those vampires put up a hell of a fight.'",
"Vanik: I just hope we weren't too late. I'm not sure what they did to this       Moth Priest, but he doesn't look right.",
"Vanik: I don't know, maybe. Won't know until we get him out of there.",
"Vanik: I'm working on it, now give me some silence so I can think.",
"Dexion Evicus: I serve my master's will. But my master is dead, and his enemies               will pay!",
"Dexion: By the divines! It's as if my eyes have been opened! I am blinded by        the light of your majesty. I...I must obey you. What would you have of        me, master?",
"Dragonborn: I command you to travel to Castle Volkihar.",
"Dexion: Certainly. Where can I find this castle?",
"Dragonborn: Off the northern coast of Skyrim, due west of Solitude.",
"Dexion: I'll set out at once, then.",
"Harkon: Well done! Somehow I knew it would be you and Serana who found our        moth priest.",
"Dragonborn: I have made the Moth Priest my thrall.",
"Harkon: Yes, I see that. I trust his capture was not too difficult a task?",
"The Dawnguard tried to stop me, but they posed no threat.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I wish I could have been there to hear the sounds of their screams.",
"The Dawnguard were there. They fought well, but not well enough.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         They are determined and well-armed, but foolish if they think they         can defy us. We will deal with them in time.",
"The Dawnguard were protecting him, and they nearly killed me.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         We both know that a band of fools with crossbows is no match for a         scion of the ancient blood. I admit, I do not entirely understand         your sense of humor.",
"Well, your thrall awaits and we have given him the Elder Scroll.        Command him to read it, and let us hear the words of prophecy together.",
"Dexion: Master, I have done as you asked and traveled here.",
"Dragonborn: I have a new task for you, thrall.",
"Dexion: Of course. What is it that you need me to do?",
"Dragonborn: You must read an Elder Scroll.",
"Dexion: Ah, yes, the Elder Scroll! I admit, I'm looking forward to this.",
"Dragonborn: Then you may begin your reading.",
"Dexion: Of course, master. Now, if everyone will please be quiet, I must        concentrate.",
"Dexion: I see a vision before me, an image of a great bow. I know this weapon!        It is Auriel's Bow! Now a voice whispers, saying 'Among the night's        children, a dread lord will rise. In an age of strife, when dragons        return to the realm of men, darkness will mingle with light and the        night and day will be as one. The voice fades and the words begin to        shimmer and distort. But wait, there is more here. The secret of the        bow's power is written elsewhere. I think there is more to the        prophecy, recorded in other scrolls. Yes, I see them now... One        contains the ancient secrets of the dragons, and the other speaks of        the potency of ancient blood. My vision darkens, and I see no more. To        know the complete prophecy, we must have the other two scrolls.",
"Harkon: That was...not as useful as I would have liked. Even so, you did well.",
"Dragonborn: Do you know where these other scrolls are?",
"Harkon: My traitor wife stole one of them away and then disappeared. As for        the other, the last that I heard, it was lost in the bowels of a        Dwemer ruin. It seems our work is not yet done. But I have waited this        long, and we are so very close now. I can wait a bit longer.",
"Serana: Do you have a moment to talk?",
"What's on your mind?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         That Moth Priest, Dexion. He said we needed two other Elder Scrolls.         I think I know where we can start looking.",
"Can't it wait?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Well, you could waste a lot of time trying to figure out our next         move, or you could let me help. Your choice.",
"Why didn't you say something earlier?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • Didn't want that lot getting wind of it. Especially my father.         • Half the people in your little crew would just as soon kill me as           talk to me. That doesn't exactly make me want to open up. I got a           warmer welcome from my father, and that's saying something.",
"What is it between the two of you?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Ever since he decided to make that prophecy his calling, we kind of         drifted apart.",
"Do you trust Harkon at all?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         It's not a question of trust...he's just obsessed with the prophecy.         And from what I can tell, an thousand extra years of obsession haven't         made him any better. We should have found him a hobby.",
"Does Harkon even care about you anymore?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         You know, I've asked myself the same thing. I¹ thought¹...I hoped that         if he saw me, he might feel something again. But I guess I don't         really factor in at this point.",
"Dragonborn: So where is this Elder Scroll?",
"Serana: We need to find my mother, Valerica. She'll definitely know where it        is, and if we're lucky, she actually has it herself.",
"Dragonborn: You said you didn't know where she went.",
"Serana: The last time I saw her, she said that she'd go somewhere safe...        somewhere that my father would never search. Other than that, she        wouldn't tell me anything. But the way she said it...'someplace he'd        never search.' It was cryptic, yet she called attention to it.",
"Sounds like she was being cautious.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Maybe. What I can't figure out is why she said it that way.",
"We can't waste time on cryptic clues.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         If you have a better lead than this, I'm all ears.",
"Maybe your mother didn't trust you, either.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         That's always a possibility. She was almost as obsessed as my father         by the time she shut me in. But I can't worry about that now. We need         the scroll, and she's our only lead.",
"Besides, I can't imagine a single place my father would avoid looking.        And he's had all this time, too. Any ideas?",
"Hiding with the Dawnguard?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • I doubt my mother would waste her time with those fools. They           probably would have tried to kill her, and that has a way of souring           relationships. Any other ideas?",
"Sealed away like you were?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I don't think so. She said she wanted to stay awake in case the         situation was resolved. It had to be one of us, and, well, she's so         much more powerful than I am. It just made sense for her to be out         there. Anything else?",
"How about right here, in the castle?² / In Castle Volkihar?²        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Wait...that almost makes sense!",
"All of the ingredients for our potions came from there. She used to say        that my father couldn't stand the place. Too...peaceful.",
"Dragonborn: Isn't that pretty risky, staying around the castle?",
"Serana: Oh, absolutely. But my mother's not a coward. That is...I don't think        we'll actually trip over her there. But it's worth a look.",
"How can we get in without your father noticing?²        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Trust me. I lived here for a very long time and I know every nook and         cranny.",
"They aren't going to let us use the front door.²        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         True. But I know a way we can get to the courtyard without arousing         suspicion.",
"There's an unused inlet on the northern side of the island that was        used by the previous owners to bring supplies into the castle. An old        escape tunnel from the castle exits there. I think that's our way in.",
"Let's go to the castle's secret entrance.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • Come on. It's just around the side.         • It's around the side of the castle. Let's move.         • Well, I don't take just anyone into the secret parts of the place           I grew up. Get rid of this interloper and you and I can be on our           way. I'll wait for you at the dock.",
"Actually, I have some things to do first.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Don't let me stand in your way, then. I'll be at the dock whenever         you're ready.",
"Serana: Yeah, just around this bend. Castle looks so big from down here. I        mean, it is big, but, well, even bigger.",
"Serana: The old water cistern. One some days, this smell would just...be glad        you weren't here then. Take a left up here. This is one of those weird        double-barred security measures that my father put in when he got more        paranoid. If we follow that path around, we can find the other switch.        This leads out to the courtyard. Just head for the door.",
"Serana: We've made it to the courtyard. Oh no... What happened to this place?        Everything's been torn down... The whole place looks...well, dead. It's        like we're the first to set foot here in centuries. This used to lead        into the castle's great hall. It looks like my father had it sealed up.        I used to walk through here after evening meals. It was beautiful,        once. This was my mother's garden. It...do you know how beautiful        something can be when it's tended by a master for hundreds of years?        She would have hated to see it like this. Wait... Something's wrong        with the moondial here. Some of the crests are missing and the dial is        askew. I didn't even know the crests could be removed. Maybe my        mother's trying to tell us something? I'm telling you, there's        something strange with the moondial.",
"Dragonborn: What happened to the castle courtyard?",
"Serana: If I had to guess, I'd say the moment mother fled the castle, father        went on a rampage. Knowing him, anything at all that reminded him of        her was just destroyed.",
"Dragonborn: Then he just walled it off.",
"Serana: It appears that way. I suppose he wanted to put the past behind him.        Perhaps if he had spent more time with us, he would have recognized        the beauty for himself.",
"Dragonborn: What's so special about the moondial?",
"Serana: Well, as far as I'm aware it's the only one in existence. The previous        owners of the castle had a sundial in the courtyard, and obviously        that didn't appeal to my mother. She persuaded an elven artisan to make        some improvements. You can see the plates that show the phases of the        moons, Masser and Secunda.",
"Dragonborn: Does it work?",
"Serana: That's the thing...what's the point of a moondial? I always wondered        why she didn't just have the whole thing ripped out. But she loved it.        I don't know. I guess it's like having a piece of art, if you're into        that sort of thing.",
"Dragonborn: So what exactly am I doing to it?",
"Serana: Hard to say. Maybe if we found the missing crests, we could figure it        out. Look around for the missing crests. Even in this mess, they should        stick out.",
"Serana: Very clever, mother. Very clever. I've never been in those tunnels        before, but I'd bet they run right under the courtyard and into the        tower ruins. Well, at least we're getting closer. Let's go.",
"Serana: I've never even seen this part of the castle before. Be careful. I        don't know what might be around.",
"Serana: I don't think we've reached the top yet. I'd bet there's some kind of        secret passage around here.",
"Serana: Leave it to my mother...always smarter than I gave her credit for.",
"Serana: Look at this place. This has to be it! I knew she was deep into        necromancy. I mean, she taught me everything I know. But I had no idea        she had a setup like this. Look at all this. She must have spent years        collecting these components. And what's this thing?",
"Serana: I'm not sure about this circle, but it's obviously...something. Let's        take a look around. There has to be something here that tells us where        she's gone.",
"Do you think this would help? (Give journal)²        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         You've found her journal! Let me take a look at it. (jump to 'What's         this 'Soul Cairn'...')",
"What exactly are we looking for?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         My mother was meticulous about her research. If we can find her notes,         there might be some hints in there.",
"Did your mother keep gargoyles here?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Not that I ever saw. My mother had a bit of a thing for magical         constructs. Not...not what you're thinking. She just found them         fascinating.",
"Your mother maintained quite a laboratory.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I had no idea that her laboratory even existed. She had an alchemy         setup in her drawing room, but nothing that even comes close to what's         here.",
"What did she research?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Looking at the equipment and materials, it looks like she was trying          to advance her necromancy.",
"To what end?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I don't know. Certainly not longevity. Kind of a waste of time for           a vampire.",
"Dragonborn: I've found your mother's notes.",
"Serana: You did? Let me see them.",
"Dragonborn: What's this 'Soul Cairn' that she mentions?",
"Serana: I only know what she told me. She had a theory about soul gems. That        the souls inside of them don't just vanish when they're used...they        end up in the Soul Cairn.",
"Dragonborn: Why did she care where used souls went?",
"Serana: The Soul Cairn is home to very powerful beings. Necromancers send them        souls, and receive powers of their own in return. My mother spent a lot        of time trying to contact them directly, to travel to the Soul Cairn        itself.",
"Dragonborn: If she made it there, we'll find her.",
"Serana: That circle in the center of the room is definitely some type of        portal. If I'm reading this right, there's a formula here that should        give us safe passage into the Soul Cairn.",
"Dragonborn: What do we need?",
"Serana: A handful of soul gem shards, some finely-ground bone meal, a good bit        of purified void salts... Oh...damn it...",
"Dragonborn: What's wrong?",
"Serana: We're also going to need a sample of her blood. Which...if we could        get that, we wouldn't even be trying to do this in the first place.",
"Dragonborn: You share her blood.",
"Serana: Hmmm. Not bad. We'd better hope that's good enough. Mistakes with these        kinds of portals can be...gruesome. Anyway, enough of that. Let's get        started.",
"Are all of those ingredients here?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Oh, definitely. Mother would have plenty of those materials in her         laboratory, you just need to find them.",
"Serana: Then the rest is up to me. Are you ready to go? I'm not entirely sure        what this thing is going to do when I add my blood.",
"Can I ask you something first?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Of course. What is it?",
"What will you do if we find your mother?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I've been asking myself the same thing since we came back to the          castle. She was so sure of what we did to my father, I couldn't help          but go along with her. I never thought of the cost.",
"It sounds like she did everything for your sake.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Possibly. I guess even a vampire mother is still a mother. She           worried about me. About all of us. But she wanted to get me as far           away from my father as possible before he really went over the edge.",
"Then it all changed. She became a different person. They both did.",
"It sounds like she was pretty selfish.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           She wasn't, always. But I think you're right. She was practically           smirking as we left home. Almost like she was proud of herself. Like           she didn't just want to stop my father...she wanted to stick it to           him, too.",
"We won't know until we find her.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Yes...yes, you're right. I'm sorry. I just didn't expect anyone to            care how I felt about her. Thank you. Are we ready then?",
"Let's get that portal open.            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             All right. Here goes.",
"Serana: By the blood of my ancestors... She actually did it...created a portal        to the Soul Cairn. Incredible.",
"Serana: Are you alright? That looked painful.",
"Dragonborn: It was. What happened?",
"Serana: Now that I think about it...I should have expected that. Sorry. It's        hard to describe. The Soul Cairn is...well, hungry, for lack of a        better word. It's trying to take your life essence as payment.",
"Dragonborn: So there's no way in, then.",
"Serana: There might be, but I don't think you're going to like it. Vampires        aren't counted among the living. I could probably go through there        without a problem.",
"Dragonborn: Are you saying that I need to become a vampire?",
"Serana: Not your first choice, I'd guess.",
"Dragonborn: There has to be another way.",
"Serana: Maybe. We could just 'pay the toll' another way. It wants a soul, so        we give it a soul. Yours.",
"Dragonborn: Wouldn't that kill me?",
"Serana: My mother taught me a trick or two. I could partially soul trap you,        and offer that gem to the Ideal Masters. It might be enough to satisfy        them. It would make you a bit weaker when we travel through the Soul        Cairn, but we might be able to fix that once we're inside. Maybe.",
"Dragonborn: Those are my only options?",
"Serana: I'm sorry. I wish I knew a better way, something that would be easier        for you. Just know that...whatever path you choose, I won't think any        less of you. Sometimes things just have to be done. I know that better        than anybody.",
"Dragonborn: I don't see another way. I'll become a vampire.",
"Serana: Are you sure? I'm willing to turn you, but you need to think it        through. You'd become the very thing you'd sworn to destroy. I don't        know how the Dawnguard will react.",
"You're right. Let me think about it.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I understand. Take your time.",
"In that case, I'm glad you're the one doing it.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Let's not waste too much time, then.",
"Let's just get it over with.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          As you wish.",
"Dragonborn: Soul trap me. I won't feel right as a vampire.",
"Serana: Are you sure? I'm willing to do it, but you need to think it through.        You'll remain mortal, but you'll find yourself weakened within the        Soul Cairn.",
"You're right. Let me think about it.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I understand. Take your time.",
"Don't worry about it.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Oh. Good.",
"Let's just get this over with.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          As you wish.",
"Dragonborn: I'm looking for an Elder Scroll.",
"Urag: And what do you plan to do with it? Do you even know what you're asking      about?",
"Tell me more about the Elder Scrolls.      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       I knew it. Everyone comes in here, expecting my help, but they don't       even have the proper questions. An Elder Scroll is an instrument of       immense knowledge and power. To read an Elder Scroll, a person must       have the most rigorously trained mind, or else risk madness. Even so,       the Divines usually take the reader's sight as a price.",
"Who wrote the Elder Scrolls?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        It would take a month to explain to you how that very question doesn't        even make sense. The Scrolls exist here, with us, but are also beyond        and beneath. Before and after. They are bits of Divine made substance        so we could know them. Sorry. Talking about the Scrolls, you usually        end up in irritating and vague metaphors like that. Some people who        study them devoutly go mad.",
"All right. So do you have one that I could use?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Ha!",
"Of course I do. Do you have one here?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       You think even if I did have one here, I would let you see it? It would       be kept under the highest security. The greatest thief in the world       wouldn't be able to lay a finger on it.",
"Do you at least have any information on them?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Of course.",
"Dragonborn: This 'Ruminations' book is incomprehensible.",
"Urag: Aye, that's the work of Septimus Signus. He's the world's master on the      nature of Elder Scrolls, but...well. He's been gone for a long while.      Too long.",
"Where did he go?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Somewhere up north, in the ice fields. Said he found some old Dwemer       artifact, but...well, that was years ago. Haven't heard from him since.",
"He's dead?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Oh no. I hope not. But even I haven't seen him in years, and we were       close. Became obsessed with the Dwemer. Took off north saying he had       found some old artifact. Haven't seen him since. Somewhere in the ice       fields, if you want to try and find him.",
"Serana: • Let's keep moving. I feel like we're being watched.        • I'd heard stories about the Soul Cairn, but never thought I'd see it          myself. So far it's...about what I imagined.",
"Serana: Mother!",
"Valerica: Maker...it can't be. Serana?!",
"Serana: Is it really you? I can't believe it! How do we get inside? We have to        talk.",
"Valerica: Serana? What are you doing here? Where's your father?",
"Serana: He doesn't know we're here. I don't have time to explain.",
"Valerica: I must have failed. Harkon's found a way to decipher the prophecy,          hasn't he.¹",
"Serana: No, you've got it all wrong. We're here to complete the prophecy our        way, not his.",
"Valerica: Wait a moment...you've brought a stranger here? Have you lost your          mind?",
"Serana: No, you don't...",
"Valerica: You. Come forward. I would speak with you.",
"This is no ruse. I want to keep her safe.²          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Coming from one who murders vampires as a trade, I find it hard to           believe your intentions are noble.",
"Serana has sacrificed everything to prevent Harkon from completing          the prophecy. I would have expected her to explain that to you.",
"Dragonborn: That's why I'm here for the Elder Scroll.",
"Valerica: You think I'd have the audacity to place my own daughter in that          tomb for the protection of her Elder Scroll alone? The scrolls are          merely a means to an end. The key to the Tyranny of the Sun is Serana          herself.",
"Dragonborn: What do you mean?",
"Valerica: When I fled Castle Volkihar, I fled with two Elder Scrolls. The          scroll I presume you found with Serana speaks of Auriel and his          arcane weapon, Auriel's Bow. The second scroll declares that 'The          Blood of Coldharbour's Daughter will blind the eye of the Dragon.'",
"Dragonborn: How does Serana fit in?",
"Valerica: Like myself, Serana was a human once. We were devout followers of          Lord Molag Bal. Tradition dictates the females be offered to Molag          Bal on his summoning day. Few survive the ordeal. Those that do          emerge as a pure-blooded vampire. We call such confluences the          'Daughters of Coldharbour.'",
"The Tyranny of the Sun requires Serana's blood?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Now you're beginning to see why I wanted to protect Serana, and why           I've kept the other Elder Scroll as far from her as possible.",
"Serana underwent this ritual willingly?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           It was expected of her, just as it was expected of me. Being           selected as an offering to Molag Bal is an honor. She wouldn't have           dared turn her back on that.",
"Coldharbour?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           It's what some call the domain of Molag Bal. His place in Oblivion.",
"Dragonborn: Are you saying Harkon means to kill her?",
"Valerica: If Harkon obtained Auriel's Bow and Serana's blood was used to taint          the weapon, the Tyranny of the Sun would be complete. In his eyes,          she'd be dying for the good of all vampires.",
"Dragonborn: I would never allow that to happen.",
"Valerica: And how exactly do you plan on completing the prophecy without the          death of my daughter?",
"Perhaps her death is destined.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           No! I will not allow that to happen. The Elder Scrolls only tell of           events that might be, not events that will be.",
"Dragonborn: And Serana's opinion on this?",
"Valerica: You care nothing for Serana or our plight.           • You see the Tyranny of the Sun as your chance at deification, and            like Harkon you won't hesitate to destroy anything that stands in            your path.",
"Serana believes in me, why won't you?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           • Serana? This stranger may call himself vampire, but he knows            nothing of our struggle. Why should I entrust you to him?",
"Serana: This 'stranger' has done more for me in the brief time I've known him        than you've done in centuries!",
"Valerica: How dare you! I gave up everything I cared about to protect you from          that fanatic you call a father!",
"Serana: Yes, he's a fanatic...he's changed. But he's still my father. Why can't        you understand how that makes me feel?",
"Valerica: Oh, Serana. If you'd only open your eyes. The moment your father          discovers your role in the prophecy, that he needs your blood, you'd          be in terrible danger.",
"Serana: So to protect me, you decided to shut me away from everything I cared        about? You never asked me if hiding in that tomb was the best course        of action, you just expected me to follow you blindly. Both of you were        obsessed with your own paths. Your motivations might have been        different, but in the end, I'm still just a pawn to you, too. I want        us to be a family again. But I don't know if we can ever have that.        Maybe we don't deserve that kind of happiness. Maybe it isn't for us.        But we have to stop him. Before he goes too far. And to do that, we        need the Elder Scroll.",
"Valerica: I'm sorry, Serana. I didn't know...I didn't see. I've allowed my          hatred of your father to estrange us for too long. Forgive me. If you          want the Elder Scroll, it's yours.",
"Valerica: Your intentions are still somewhat unclear to me. But for Serana's          sake, I'll assist you in any way that I can.",
"Dragonborn: Do you have the Elder Scroll with you?",
"Valerica: Yes. I've kept it safely secured here ever since I was imprisoned.",
"Does that mean you can take us to it now?²            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             Yes. Please, follow me. One more word of warning. There's a dragon             that calls itself Durnehviir roaming the Cairn. The Ideal Masters             have charged him with overseeing the Keepers, and will undoubtedly             investigate the fact that the barrier has fallen.",
"Dragonborn: What do we need to do?",
"Valerica: You need to locate the tallest of the rocky spires that surround          these ruins. At their bases, the barrier's energy is being drawn from          unfortunate souls that have been exiled here. Destroy the Keepers          that are tending them, and it should bring the barrier down.",
"Dragonborn: We'll return soon.",
"Valerica: One more word of warning. There's a dragon that calls itself          Durnehviir roaming the Cairn. Be wary of him. The Ideal Masters have          charged him with overseeing the Keepers, and will undoubtedly          intervene if you're perceived as a threat. Be careful, and keep my          daughter safe.",
"Serana: Let's kill those...Keeper things and get back to the prison.",
"Dragonborn: How did you become imprisoned here?",
"Valerica: When I entered the Soul Cairn, I had intended to strike a bargain          with the Ideal Masters, the custodians of this place.",
"Dragonborn: What was the bargain?",
"Valerica: I requested refuge in the Soul Cairn, and in exchange, I would          provide the Ideal Masters the souls that they craved. If I had          foreseen the value they placed on my own soul, I would never have          come here.",
"Dragonborn: They tricked you.",
"Valerica: The Ideal Masters unleashed their Keepers and sent them to destroy          me. Fortunately, I was able to hold them at bay and retreat into          these ruins.",
"Dragonborn: You became trapped.",
"Valerica: Unfortunately, yes. Since the Keepers weren't able to claim my soul,          they had their minions construct a barrier that I'd never be able to          breach.",
"Dragonborn: You've been imprisoned here for all this time?",
"Valerica: Time has very little meaning to me. Consequently, it has little          meaning to the Ideal Masters as well. I suppose you could call this          the ultimate waiting game, each watching the other to see which will          give in.",
"Dragonborn: If I leave the Soul Cairn, can I safely return?",
"Valerica: As you've been traveling in the Soul Cairn, your body has become          attuned to it. Let's just say a tiny part of you rubbed off on it,          and in its place, a bit of the Soul Cairn filled the void. You          should find no difficulty using the portal any longer.",
"Dragonborn: Why haven't you pursued the prophecy?",
"Valerica: Harkon's vision is a world plunged in eternal darkness where the          vampire can flourish and never again fear the 'tyranny of the sun.'          What he fails to realize is how much attention would be called to          our kind if the prophecy came to fruition.",
"Dragonborn: What sort of attention?",
"Valerica: If eternal night fell, there are many who wouldn't stand for it. They          would raise armies in attempts to return things to normal. The order          of the day would be our destruction until every last vampire was          hunted down and eliminated.",
"Dragonborn: So you prefer living in the shadows.",
"Valerica: I do. It's how the vampire has survived for millennia, and the only          way we can continue to survive in the future.",
"Dragonborn: Who are the Ideal Masters?",
"Valerica: I know very little about them. They're mystic entities that lord over          the Soul Cairn, controlling every aspect from its fabric to its          appearance.",
"Dragonborn: What do they resemble?",
"Valerica: Well, some necromancers believe they are the crystalline structures          dotting the Soul Cairn. I believe there's more to it than that.",
"Dragonborn: How so?",
"Valerica: I think they transcend what we perceive as a physical form. Perhaps          they were once corporeal beings, but they've obviously reached a          point where they no longer require a tangible presence.",
"Dragonborn: And the crystals?",
"Valerica: Conduits through which the Ideal Masters speak to their underlings          and feed on their victims.",
"Dragonborn: Why would they require sustenance?",
"Valerica: The Ideal Masters's weakness is their insatiable hunger for pure          souls. It's the reason for the Soul Cairn's existence, and the only          leverage a necromancer has when bargaining with them.",
"Dragonborn: What do the Masters provide in return?",
"Valerica: The ability to summon powerful undead guardians as one would conjure          an atronach or daedra. However, the majority of necromancers that are          foolish enough to enter into a bargain with the Ideal Masters wind up          here...as harvested souls.",
"Valerica: You managed to destroy all three Keepers? Very impressive.",
"Dragonborn: Are you able to give us the scroll now?",
"Valerica: Yes. Please, follow me. Keep watch for Durnehviir. With the prison's          barrier down, he's almost certain to investigate.",
"Serana: Wait...I hear something!",
"Valerica: It's Durnehviir...he's here! Defend yourselves!",
"Valerica: Forgive my astonishment, but I never thought I'd witness the death          of that dragon.",
"Dragonborn: What makes you say that?",
"Valerica: Volumes written on Durnehviir allege that he can't be slain by normal          means. It appears they were mistaken. Unless...",
"Dragonborn: Go on.",
"Valerica: The soul of a dragon is as resilient as its owner's scaly hide. It's          possible that your killing blow merely displaced Durnehviir's          physical form while he reconstitutes himself.",
"Dragonborn: How long will that take?",
"Valerica: Minutes? Hours? Years? I can't even begin to guess. I suggest we          don't wait around to find out. Now, let's get your Elder Scroll and          you can be on your way.",
"Serana: Come on, she's leading us to the scroll.",
"Serana: That's it. That's the last scroll. Come on, let's take it to Dexion.",
"Valerica: Now that you've retrieved the Elder Scroll, you should be on your          way. If there's anything I can do before you depart, you must let          me know.",
"Can you help me get my soul back?²          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           So my daughter applied some of the lessons I taught her about           necromancy, did she? Don't worry, I think I can help you.",
"Good, I could use all the help I can get.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            Your soul essence was trapped inside a gem. When you and Serana            entered the Soul Cairn, it was 'given' to the Ideal Masters as            payment. You simply need to retrieve the gem. The moment you touch            it, your soul essence will be restored.",
"Any idea where it could be?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             There's an offering altar not terribly far from here. I'm willing             to bet that the gem you're looking for is there. Is there anything             else? Could be your last chance.",
"You're staying here?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I have no choice. As I told you before, I'm a Daughter of           Coldharbour. If I return to Tamriel, that increases Harkon's           likelihood of bringing the Tyranny of the Sun to fruition.",
"We'll return for you when we can.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            I appreciate your concern for me, but Serana is all I care about.            You must keep her safe at all costs.",
"We could use your help in Tamriel.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            As much as it pains me to send you and Serana back alone, I can't            take the risk.",
"We may never return.           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            After what I've put Serana through, I would understand if she never            wished to see me again. I leave that decision in your hands.",
"Remember that Harkon is not to be trusted. No matter what he          promises, he'll deceive you in order to get what he wants. And          promise me you'll keep my daughter safe. She's the only thing of          value I have left. Farewell. Remember that Harkon's not to be          trusted.",
"Serana: I'm glad we found the scroll, but I...I wish she could come with us.",
"Dragonborn: Why don't you come back with us?",
"Valerica: Even if I could, it would only serve to hinder your efforts. Harkon          would likely sense my return to Tamriel. The last thing you need          right now is a trail for him to follow.",
"Dragonborn: You said 'even if I could.' Why?",
"Valerica: Like Serana, I am a Daughter of Coldharbour, an¹ vampire offspring of          Molag Bal. My presence in Tamriel would simply double the risk that          Harkon could complete the prophecy.",
"Dragonborn: And if Harkon failed?",
"Valerica: The only way I'd even consider returning to Tamriel was if Harkon          were not only to fail, but to be destroyed.",
"Dragonborn: You hate him that much?",
"Valerica: You must understand that he's no longer the man I married all that          time ago. He's obsessed...insane. Everyone around him fears him as          they would a rabid dog. For all of this to end, he must die.",
"Durnehviir: Stay your weapons. I would speak with you, Qahnaarin.",
"Dragonborn: I thought you were dead.",
"Durnehviir: Cursed, not dead. Doomed to exist in this form for all eternity.            Trapped between laas and dinok, between life and death.",
"Why are we speaking?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             I believe in civility among seasoned warriors, and I find your ear             worthy of my words. My claws have rended flesh from innumerable             foes, but I have never once been felled on the field of battle.             I therefore honor-name you 'Qahnaarin,' or Vanquisher in your             tongue.",
"Didn't you try to kill me?            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             The hostility was necessary. I was bound to an oath.",
"Dragonborn: What kind of favor?",
"Durnehviir: For countless years I've roamed the Soul Cairn, in unintended            service to the Ideal Masters. Before this, I roamed the skies above            Tamriel. I desire to return there.",
"Dragonborn: What's stopping you?",
"Durnehviir: I fear that my time here has taken its toll on me. I share a bond            with this dreaded place. If I ventured far from the Soul Cairn, my            strength would begin to wane until I was no more.",
"Dragonborn: How could I help?",
"Durnehviir: I will place my name with you and grant you the right to call my            name from Tamriel. Do me this simple honor and I will fight at your            side as your Grah-Zeymahzin, your Ally, and teach you my Thu'um.",
"Dragonborn: Just call your name in Tamriel? That's it?",
"Durnehviir: Trivial in your mind, perhaps. For me, it would mean a great deal.            I don't require an answer, Qahnaarin. Simply speak my name to the            heavens when you feel the time is right.",
"Dragonborn: Why do you call me 'Qahnaarin'?",
"Durnehviir: In my language, the Qahnaarin is the Vanquisher, the one who has            bested a fellow dovah in battle.",
"Dragonborn: Fellow dovah? I am not a dragon.            Durnehviir: Forgive me, my instinct was to grant you this title. I am uncertain            why. Perhaps one day it will become clear to both of us.",
"Dragonborn: How did you end up in the Soul Cairn?",
"Durnehviir: There was a time when I called Tamriel my home, but those days have            long since passed. The dovah roamed the skies, vying for their            small slices of territory that resulted in immense and ultimately            fatal battles.",
"Dragonborn: Were you a part of all that?",
"Durnehviir: I was. But unlike some of my brethren, I sought solutions outside            the norm in order to maintain my superiority. I began to explore            what the dovah call 'Alok-Dilon,' the ancient forbidden art that            you call necromancy.",
"Dragonborn: So you sought the Soul Cairn for answers.",
"Durnehviir: The Ideal Masters assured me that my powers would be unmatched,            that I could raise legions of the undead. In return, I was to serve            them as a Keeper until the death of the one who calls herself            Valerica.",
"Dragonborn: They didn't tell you she was immortal.",
"Durnehviir: I discovered too late that the Ideal Masters favor deception over            honor and had no intention of releasing me from my binding. They            had control of my mind, but fortunately they couldn't possess my            soul.",
"Dragonborn: Is that why you're free now?",
"Durnehviir: Free? No. I've been here too long, Qahnaarin. The Soul Cairn has            become a part of what I am. I can never fully call Tamriel my home            again, or I would surely perish. I only hope that you will allow me            the precious moments of time there through your call.",
"Serana: The sooner we get the scroll home, the sooner we can deal with my        father.",
"Dexion: I trust your journey was successful?",
"Dragonborn: I've brought the Elder Scrolls.",
"Dexion: I'm sorry, my friend. I can no longer be of use in this matter.",
"Dragonborn: Why? What's happened?",
"Dexion: It's my fault. In my haste to read the first scroll, I neglected the        careful preparation required. I thought I'd be able to allay the        after effects¹, but I was wrong. Now I'm paying for it.",
"Dragonborn: That covering on your eyes. Are you--",
"Dexion: Blind? Yes. I'm afraid so.",
"Dragonborn: Can anything be done to help you?",
"Dexion: No. It'll have to run its course, and there's always the chance I may        never recover.",
"Dragonborn: Then we're finished.",
"Dexion: No, there's another way. The question is, how much are you willing to        risk to find Auriel's Bow?",
"Dragonborn: What do I need to do?",
"Dexion: I can't guarantee you'll be free from harm. Becoming blind could be the        least of your worries.",
"Dragonborn: Don't worry about that. Just tell me.",
"Dexion: Yes, how may I serve you, milord?",
"Dragonborn: I've brought the Elder Scrolls.",
"Dexion: I'm afraid I won't be able to help you with the scrolls any longer,        milord. Please, do not be angry with me.",
"Dragonborn: What are you talking about?",
"Dexion: I'm afraid in my haste to read the first scroll, I neglected the time        I needed to prepare. The failure is purely mine to bear. As you can        see from my bandages, it's not that I'm unwilling, it is that I'm        physically unable.",
"Dragonborn: You're blind!",
"Dexion: Oh please, milord! Please...forgive me!",
"Dragonborn: I don't suppose there's a cure.",
"Dexion: If only such a miracle existed, I'd overcome the impossible in order        to secure it if it meant pleasing you.",
"Dragonborn: Then we have no further need of you.",
"Dexion: Although I would gladly die by your hand, perhaps I could offer an        alternative way to read the scrolls?",
"Dragonborn: Go on.",
"Dexion: Oh thank you, milord. Thank you!",
"Dragonborn: Just get to it!",
"Dexion: Scattered across Tamriel are secluded locations known only as Ancestor        Glades. There's one in Skyrim, in the Pine Forest. Performing the        Ritual of the Ancestor Moth within the glade should provide the        answers you seek.",
"Dragonborn: Explain this 'ritual.'",
"Dexion: It involves carefully removing the bark from the Canticle Tree which        will in turn attract Ancestor Moths to you. Once enough of the moths        are following, they'll provide you with the second sight needed to        decipher the scrolls.",
"Dragonborn: Carefully gather the bark? How?",
"Dexion: In keeping with tradition, you must use a specific tool in the Ancestor        Glade, an implement known as a Draw Knife. Every Moth Priest is taught        this ritual, but few ever get the chance to perform it...you should        consider yourself fortunate if it works for you.",
"Dragonborn: Do I need to read the scrolls in any particular order?",
"Dexion: From what I saw in the vision, the Elder Scroll which foreshadows the        defiance of the gods with the blood of mortals is the key to the        prophecy.",
"Dragonborn: How's a moth related to the Elder Scrolls?",
"Dexion: Well, as I am sure you've figured out by now, it's no mere coincidence        we are named 'Moth Priests.' The voice of the Ancestor Moth has always        been an integral part of reading the Elder Scrolls.",
"Dragonborn: Moths barely make a sound, let alone speak.",
"Dexion: Oh, the moths don't literally read the scrolls...but they maintain a        connection to ancient magic that allows the Moth Priests to decipher        them. If you listen closely when you find the glade, you should be able        to hear their song...a soft, harmonious trilling. It's through this        ancestral chorus that the moths tap into a form of primal augur and        become a conduit for deciphering the scrolls.",
"Dragonborn: How does that help the Moth Priest?",
"Dexion: By having the Ancestor Moths close to the Moth Priest, they can utilize        the conduit and share the moth's augury. Only the most resilient of        priests can do it this way...it takes years of practice to interpret        the harmony.",
"Dragonborn: Then how do I even stand a chance?",
"Dexion: You've come this far, and you've found several Elder Scrolls. Whether        you believe it or not, the scrolls have a mind of their own. If they        didn't want you to find them, they wouldn't allow it. Because of this,        I strongly believe you were meant to hear the ancestral chorus. Only        one way to find out.",
"Dragonborn: What went wrong?",
"Dexion: Deciphering one of the Elder Scrolls is nothing like reading a simple        book. There is quite a bit of ritual and concentration required. It        can take months or even years to complete a single scroll and even        then, months to recover.",
"Dragonborn: Is it normal for Moth Priests to go blind?",
"Dexion: Sadly, yes. It is the inevitable fate we agree to pursue when reading        the Elder Scrolls. It generally does not occur until a Moth Priest is        in his latter years, but in my case I simply was not preparing myself        properly.",
"Serana: This must be the place. Hmph...not very impressive, is it? If this ends        up being a wasted trip, your friend Dexion and I are going to have some        words when we get back.",
"Serana: Wow. Look at this place. No one's been here in centuries. I doubt        there's any other place like it in Skyrim. It's beautiful.",
"Serana: Well, we got the knife...now all we need to do is track down one of        those Canticle Trees.",
"Serana: Hope those moths like that bark as much as Dexion said they would.        Dexion didn't really give us a lot to go on, did he?",
"Serana: Look at them...they've definitely taken a liking to you. And unless        I'm seeing things, you're starting to...glimmer.",
"Serana: Woah! I think that might have been what we were waiting for. Let's        head back up there and see if we can read the scrolls.",
"Serana: Nervous?",
"Serana: Are you okay? Almost thought I lost you there...you went as white as        the snow.",
"Don't worry, I'm fine.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I never trusted those damn scrolls. Who knows what those things could         have done to you...just look at Dexion.",
"That felt strange.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I could see it in your eyes. You looked about a thousand leagues away.",
"Never mind that...it worked!        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         After everything we've been through, it had damn well better work.",
"What about Auriel's Bow? Do you know where we can find it?",
"Dragonborn: It's in a place called Darkfall Cave.",
"Serana: Then it's almost over.",
"Where is this 'Darkfall Cave?'",
"Dragonborn: The scrolls gave me its exact location.",
"Serana: Then let's get going. I want to get there before my father has a chance        to track us down.",
"Serana: These people were...why would anyone want to set up camp here? I wonder        what happened to them.",
"Serana: What's that? I can feel some kind of power from it...",
"Gelebor: Come forward. You have nothing to fear here.",
"Gelebor: I am Knight-Paladin Gelebor. Welcome to the Great Chantry of Auri-El.",
"Dragonborn: This cave is a temple to Auriel?",
"Gelebor: Auriel, Auri-El, Alkosh, Akatosh...so many different names for the         sovereign of the snow elves.",
"Dragonborn: Snow elves? You're a Falmer?",
"Gelebor: I prefer snow elf. The name 'Falmer' usually holds a negative meaning         to most travelers. Those twisted creatures you call Falmer, I call         the Betrayed.",
"Dragonborn: I imagine you know why we're here.",
"Gelebor: Of course. You're here for Auriel's Bow. Why else would you be here?         I can help you get it, but first I must have your assistance.",
"What type of assistance do you need?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          I need you to kill Arch-Curate Vyrthur...my brother.",
"Do I have a choice?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Absolutely. You could turn around and travel back from wherever you          started empty handed¹, or you could assist me.",
"How did you know?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          For the thousands of years I've served as the Chantry's sentinel,          there hasn't been a single visitor here for any other reason. They          request Auriel's Bow, and I request their assistance. It's been          repeated so many times, I can't imagine it any other way.",
"Dragonborn: Kill your brother, why?",
"Gelebor: The kinship between us is gone. I don't understand what he's become,         but he's no longer the brother I once knew. It was the Betrayed...         they did something to him, I just don't know why Auri-El would allow         this to happen.",
"Dragonborn: What exactly did the Betrayed do?",
"Gelebor: They swept into the Chantry without warning and began killing everyone         without pause.",
"Dragonborn: Didn't you fight back?",
"Gelebor: The Chantry was a place of peaceful worship. I led a small group of         paladins, but we were no match for the Betrayed's sheer numbers. They         slaughtered everyone and stormed the Inner Sanctum where I believe         they corrupted Vyrthur.",
"Dragonborn: You don't even know if he's alive.",
"Gelebor: He's alive. I've seen him. But something's wrong. He never looks as         though he's in pain or under duress. He just...stands there and         watches, as though waiting.",
"Dragonborn: Have you tried getting into the Inner Sanctum?",
"Gelebor: Leaving the wayshrines unguarded would be violating my sacred duty as         a Knight-Paladin of Auriel. And an assault on the Betrayed guarding         the Inner Sanctum would only end with my death.",
"Dragonborn: Wayshrine?",
"Gelebor: Yes, let me show you.",
"Serana: So, this is snow elf magic. Incredible.",
"Gelebor: This structure is known as a wayshrine. They were used for meditation         and for transport when the Chantry was a place of enlightenment.         Prelates of these shrines were charged with teaching the mantras of         Auri-El to our Initiates.",
"Serana: What's that basin in the center signify?",
"Gelebor: Once the Initiate completed his mantras, he'd dip a ceremonial ewer         in the basin of the wayshrine's center and proceed to the next         wayshrine.",
"Serana: So these Initiates had to lug around a heavy pitcher of water.         Marvelous. How long would they have to do that?",
"Gelebor: Well, once the Initiate's enlightenment was complete, he'd bring the         ewer to the Chantry's Inner Sanctum. Pouring the contents of the ewer         into the sacred basin of the Sanctum would allow him to enter for an         audience with the Arch-Curate himself.",
"Serana: All that just to end up dumping it out? Makes no sense to me.",
"Gelebor: It's symbolic. I don't expect you to understand.",
"Serana: So, let's get this straight. We need to do all that nonsense to get        into the temple, so we can kill your brother and claim Auriel's Bow?",
"Gelebor: I know how it all sounds, but if there was another way I'd have done         it long ago. The only way to get to my brother is by following in the         Initiates' footsteps and traveling from wayshrine to wayshrine just         as they did. The first lay at the end of Darkfall Passage, a cavern         that represents the absence of enlightenment.",
"Dragonborn: How many more wayshrines are there?",
"Gelebor: There are five in total, spread far across the Chantry.",
"Dragonborn: These caves must be massive.",
"Gelebor: Caves? Oh, no. The Chantry encompasses far more than a few caves, as         you'll soon discover. But before I send you on your way, you'll need         the Initiate's Ewer.",
"Dragonborn: So I need to fill this at each wayshrine?",
"Gelebor: Once you've located a wayshrine, there will be spectral Prelate         tending to it. They will allow you to draw the waters from the         shrine's basin as if you've been enlightened.",
"Dragonborn: I'll be off then.",
"Gelebor: This may be the last time we're able to converse. If you have any         questions before you leave, I suggest you ask them. Otherwise, all I         can do now is grant you my hopes for a safe journey.",
"Gelebor: Questions? I expected as much.",
"Dragonborn: Who are the spectral Prelates you mentioned?",
"Gelebor: They're ghosts of the snow elf priests that tended the wayshrines         before being slaughtered by the Betrayed. Through the grace of         Auri-El, they were restored to their spectral form to enable them to         continue their duties.",
"Dragonborn: Good, they should be able to help us.",
"Gelebor: I'm afraid in their current form, they still believe the Chantry to be         an active center of worship. They won't respond to you in any way         other than believing that you're an Initiate and you're undertaking         the journey to the Inner Sanctum.",
"Dragonborn: What is the Chantry of Auri-El?",
"Gelebor: This is, or was, the epicenter for our religion. Most of the snow elf         people worshipped Auri-El. The Chantry was constructed near the         beginning of the First Era to provide a retreat to those that wished         to become enlightened.",
"Dragonborn: Most snow elves?",
"Gelebor: Our empire had temples to some of the other deities: Trinimac,         Syrabane, Jephre and Phynaster rounded out the rest. But those temples         paled in comparison to the glory of the Chantry and its wayshrines.",
"Dragonborn: The wayshrines are part of the Chantry then?",
"Gelebor: Oh yes. They were an important part of the process here. They         represented the steps the Initiates took on the path to total         enlightenment. Sadly, the magic used to construct these wonders were         lost long before I arrived here.",
"Dragonborn: Who were your people?",
"Gelebor: We were once a wealthy and prosperous society that occupied a portion         of Skyrim. Unfortunately, we were constantly at war with the Nords         who claimed the land as their ancestral home.",
"Dragonborn: It appears the Nords won.",
"Gelebor: In a manner of speaking. We had always maintained an uneasy alliance         with the underground-dwelling dwarves, and when faced with extinction         we turned to them for help. Surprisingly, they agreed to protect us         but demanded a terrible price...the blinding of our race.",
"Dragonborn: Everyone couldn't have possibly agreed to that.",
"Gelebor: There were splinter groups that resisted the agreement, and even some         that sought alternate alliances. But when it was all said and done,         those elves were either slaughtered, vanished or gave up and took the         dwarves' bargain.",
"Dragonborn: What turned your people into the Betrayed?",
"Gelebor: I've often asked myself the same question. The blinding of my race         was supposedly accomplished with a toxin. Certainly not enough to         devolve them into the sad and twisted beings they've become.",
"Dragonborn: Why weren't the snow elves here afflicted?",
"Gelebor: The Chantry is quite isolated, so it took some time for word of the         dwarves' offer to reach us here. By the time the compact had been         completed, it was too late for us to even attempt to intervene.",
"Dragonborn: Is that why you had retained your sight?",
"Gelebor: Correct. We only numbered perhaps a hundred at the time, so our",
"Dragonborn: You mean the Betrayed.",
"Gelebor: Yes. They swarmed the Chantry in vast numbers until we were completely         overrun. We never really stood a chance. I assume that the Arch-Curate         was corrupted by them when they found a way to breach the Inner         Sanctum.",
"Dragonborn: There were others here like you?",
"Gelebor: Vyrthur and myself are the only two snow elves that remain.",
"Serana: Well...that wasn't as unpleasant as I thought it would be. Kind of        soothing, actually. I feel a little warmer, now.",
"Serana: Looks like these Falmer are here to stay. They must be who that priest        was calling 'the Betrayed.'",
"Serana: Hmmm. Pull chains and traps. Be careful here. Whatever's on the other        side of this, the Falmer wanted to keep there.",
"Serana: This is the kind of thing I've been wanting to see. Makes everything        worth it. I think that's another wayshrine up there. Here we go.",
"Sidanyis: Welcome, Initiate. This is the Wayshrine of Illumination. Are you          prepared to honor the mantras of Auri-El and fill your vessel with          His enlightenment?",
"Dragonborn: Yes.",
"Sidanyis: Then behold Auri-El's gift, my child. May it light your path as you          seek tranquility within the Inner Sanctum. May Auri-El's brilliance          illuminate your path.",
"Serana: This is incredible. It's like a whole other world. Come on, the bow        has to be in this valley somewhere. Is that another one of those        wayshrines up there? I wonder where this one goes...",
"Athring: Welcome, Initiate. This is the Wayshrine of Sight. Are you prepared         to honor the mantras of Auri-El and fill your vessel with His         enlightenment?",
"Dragonborn: Yes.",
"Athring: Then behold Auri-El's gift, my child. May it speed your journey to the         Inner Sanctum. May Auri-El's light guide you in your darkest hours.",
"Serana: Is that another one of those wayshrines up there? I wonder where this        one goes...",
"Celegriath: You've reached the Wayshrine of Learning, Initiate. Are you            prepared to honor the mantras of Auri-El and fill your vessel with            His enlightenment?",
"Dragonborn: Yes.",
"Celegriath: Auri-El bless you, child. For you are a step closer to the Inner            Sanctum and everlasting wisdom. May Auri-El's warmth imbue your            body with strength.",
"Serana: If we open that one, we'll be able to move around this valley a lot        faster.",
"Nirilor: You've arrived at the Wayshrine of Resolution. Are you prepared to         honor the mantras of Auri-El and fill your vessel with His         enlightenment?",
"Dragonborn: Yes.",
"Nirilor: Then go forth, child. May the enrichment of Auri-El strengthen your         resolve as you undertake your journey to the Inner Sanctum. May         Auri-El's glow shield you from your enemy.",
"Serana: Poor thing. I know it would have tried to kill us, but still...",
"Serana: Not the most solid construction. About what I'd expect from...creatures        like this. Looks like they're better at making traps than they are at        making bridges. A strange race, these Falmer.",
"Edhelbor: You've found the Wayshrine of Radiance, Initiate. Are you prepared          to honor the mantras of Auri-El and fill your vessel with His          enlightenment?",
"Dragonborn: Yes.",
"Edhelbor: May the blessings of Auri-El protect you as you climb the road to          the Inner Sanctum and final enlightenment. May Auri-El's radiance          fill your heart with joy.",
"Serana: That...that has to be the place. I've never seen a building like that        before. It looks like some kind of temple. Never saw anything like this        back on the island.",
"Serana: That is a statue of Auriel, but it's using the older signs of his        power. This temple must be ancient. The bow has to be in here.",
"Serana: These Falmer are...they're frozen in the ice. I wonder how long they've        been like this. And I thought the Soul Cairn was creepy.",
"Vyrthur: Did you really come here expecting to claim Auriel's Bow? You've done         exactly as I predicted and brought your fetching companion to me.",
"Serana: Wait, is he talking about me?",
"Vyrthur: Which, I'm sorry to say, means your usefulness is at an end!",
"Vyrthur: An impressive display, but a wasted effort. You delay nothing but your         own deaths!",
"Serana: Watch out! He's pulling down the ceiling!",
"Vyrthur: Finish them!",
"Vyrthur: This has gone on long enough. Child, my life ended long before you         were born!",
"Vyrthur: No...I won't let you ruin centuries of preparations...",
"Serana: Surrender and give us the bow!",
"Vyrthur: Death first!",
"Serana: Are you alright? Come on, we can do this. I know we can. He's up there,        on the balcony. Come on!",
"Serana: Enough, Vyrthur. Give us the bow!",
"Vyrthur: How dare you. I was the Arch-Curate of Auri-El, girl. I had the ears         of a god!",
"Serana: Until the 'Betrayed' corrupted you. Yes, yes. We've heard this sad        story.",
"Vyrthur: Gelebor and his kind are easily manipulated fools. Look into my eyes,         Serana. You tell me what I am.",
"Serana: You're...you're a vampire? But Auriel should have protected you...",
"Vyrthur: The moment I was infected by one of my own Initiates, Auri-El turned         his back on me. I swore I'd have my revenge, no matter what the cost.",
"Serana: You want to take revenge...on a god?",
"Vyrthur: Auri-El himself may have been beyond my reach, but his influence on         our world wasn't. All I needed was the blood of a vampire and his own         weapon, Auriel's Bow.",
"Serana: The blood of a vampire...Auriel's Bow... It...it was you? You created        that prophecy?",
"Vyrthur: A prophecy that lacked a single, final ingredient...the blood of a         pure vampire. The blood of a Daughter of Coldharbour.",
"Serana: You were waiting...all this time for someone with my blood to come        along. Well, too bad for you...I intend on keeping it. Let's see if        your blood has any power to it!",
"Vyrthur: What trickery is this!",
"Vyrthur: Farewell.",
"Gelebor: So, the deed has been done. The restoration of this wayshrine means         that Vyrthur must be dead and the Betrayed no longer have control         over him.",
"Dragonborn: The Betrayed weren't to blame.",
"Gelebor: What? What are you talking about?",
"Dragonborn: He was a vampire. He controlled them.",
"Gelebor: A vampire? I see. That would explain much. Deep inside, it brings me         joy that the Betrayed weren't to blame for what happened here.",
"Dragonborn: Why?",
"Gelebor: Because that means there's still hope that they might one day shed         their hatred and learn to believe in Auri-El once again. It's been         a long time since I felt that way and it's been long overdue. My         thanks, to both of you.",
"Dragonborn: You're welcome.",
"Gelebor: You risked everything to get Auri-El's Bow, and in return, you've         restored the Chantry. I can't think of a more deserving champion to         carry it than you. If you wish to learn more about the bow, or obtain         Sunhallowed Arrows for it, I'd be more than happy to help. You've but         to ask.",
"Gelebor: Please, take the bow...it's yours.",
"Dragonborn: What will happen to you now?",
"Gelebor: Even with Vyrthur gone and the Inner Sanctum destroyed, my duty as a         Knight-Paladin of Auri-El remains. I've been sworn to protect this         vale and everything it represents until I die.",
"Dragonborn: And the wayshrines?",
"Gelebor: For the time being, they will remain open. If remnants of our kind         who escaped the betrayal at the hands of the dwarves exist out there,         perhaps they will find this place one day.",
"Dragonborn: What can you tell me about Auriel's Bow?",
"Gelebor: The bow was said to be carried by Auri-El himself into battle against         the forces of Lorkhan in ancient and mythic times. Its craftsmanship         has no equal anywhere within Tamriel and possibly beyond.",
"Dragonborn: What can it do?",
"Gelebor: The bow draws its power from Aetherius itself, channeling it through         the sun. Therefore, when an arrow is loosed from the bow, it produces         a magical effect very similar to being burned by fire.",
"Dragonborn: Sounds powerful.",
"Gelebor: That's actually only a fraction of its potential. With Sunhallowed         Arrows, you would be able to produce a much more spectacular effect...         causing bursts of sunlight to envelop your foes. The sunbursts would         certainly hurt anything, but is especially devastating to the undead.",
"Dragonborn: Vyrthur said something about using blood?",
"Gelebor: Well, using an arrow with the bow that's been dipped in blood may         cause it to function differently...corrupting its purpose. That's of         course if you're foolish enough to try it.",
"Dragonborn: How do I obtain Sunhallowed Arrows?",
"Gelebor: I can actually assist you in that regard. If you were to bring me some         good quality elven arrows, I could imbue them with the proper         incantations and rituals.",
"Dragonborn: Can you make me some Sunhallowed Arrows?",
"Dragonborn: Can the Betrayed ever be cured?",
"Gelebor: I feel nothing but sympathy for the Betrayed, despite my actions         against them. But I'm afraid that they're well beyond a cure at this         point.",
"Dragonborn: Why?",
"Gelebor: The twisted forms you've seen didn't occur overnight. It isn't a         plague or a disease that ravaged our species. The dwarves may have         stolen their sight, but it took many generations for them to become         what they are today.",
"Dragonborn: Then there's no hope for them.",
"Gelebor: Perhaps they'll never return to their former appearance, but over the         centuries, I've noticed a rise in their intellect. If a line of         communication could be established with them, maybe they can find         peace. It's the only way they'll discover that they weren't always         malignant...they were once a proud and prosperous race.",
"Dragonborn: What will happen to the Chantry now?",
"Gelebor: While it would fill me with joy to see the Chantry back to its former         glory, that time has long since passed. Now that my brother's dead,         it's quite possibly I'm the last of our kind.",
"Dragonborn: Then I've contributed to your kind's extinction.",
"Gelebor: There's no need for that kind of talk. I said it was possible. It's         also quite possible that there are some other isolated conclaves of         snow elves nestled elsewhere on Nirn. I'll also assume Vyrthur didn't         exactly give you the option to stay your hand.",
"Dragonborn: What will you do then?",
"Gelebor: For the time being I will remain here, on the overlook and continue         trying to keep the Sanctum free of the Betrayed. You're always welcome         to return here at any time, of course.",
"Serana: It's...not as shiny as I was expecting. Still, it's beautiful.",
"Dragonborn: What do we do now?",
"Serana: • Well, before we spoke to my mother in the Soul Cairn, I would have          said we bring the bow to my father. But after everything with her...I          don't think we can trust him.",
"Then we kill him, before he kills us.²        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I keep thinking that there's got to be another way, but he'll turn on         us the moment he gets the chance.",
"If we do, he'll have to die.²        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I've been thinking about this for a long time. It's...it's not easy.         But I don't think we have much of a choice.",
"We have the bow, he'll listen to us.²        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Have you been paying attention to everything that's happened? He'll         betray us the second our backs are turned.",
"Maybe we can reason with him.²        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Have you been paying attention? It's obvious my father's well beyond         reason.",
"We should honor our agreement with him.²        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Are you out of your mind? The moment you hand over the bow your         usefulness ends. He'll kill you and then he'll take my blood for the         damn prophecy.",
"Let's run as far from him as we can.²        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         There's nowhere to run. And I'm certainly not moving in with my         mother, if that's what you're implying.",
"Dragonborn: Then let's face him, together.",
"Serana: • Thank you. Somehow I knew you'd understand.        • If we head back to the castle and kick the front door in, we're going          to be knee-deep in his friends. Let's head back to Isran and let him          see what we've got first. I'm betting he'll lend us a sword or two.",
"Dragonborn: Vyrthur was saying something about vampire blood and the bow...",
"Serana: It sounds like...that's the last bit of the prophecy. The blood of a        Daughter of Coldharbour can corrupt the bow.",
"Can I use your blood, then?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Sure...do you have any arrows, though? They would have to be of elven         quality, I'd guess.",
"You're a Daughter of Coldharbour.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         So I am. I guess we could use my blood. Do you have any arrows? Elven         arrows. I'm not going to just bleed on any old thing.",
"Dragonborn: Are you ready to do this?",
"Serana: I don't think you can ever be ready to kill your parent. I'm doing my        best to not think of him as my father anymore.",
"That's a good way to be thinking.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I hope so.",
"Let me know if you need anything.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         We've got enough to worry about right now. You stay focused, and I'll         worry about me.",
"Isran: The bow...you have Auriel's Bow! I've heard it described in tales, but       I could never have imagined its beauty.",
"Dragonborn: We need your help, Isran.",
"Isran: Indeed. The day hasn't been won while Harkon still walks Tamriel. But       what of Serana? Can she be trusted to lift a blade against her own kind?       Her own family?",
"Dragonborn: I trust her to do the right thing.",
"Isran: I suppose that's as much as I can hope for. Let me address the       Dawnguard, and then we'll be off. The men deserve to know we've finally       gained the upper hand. Everyone! Gather 'round! Come on then, we haven't       got all day!",
"For too long we've allowed these vampires to poison the night and kill       our people! Now, we finally have the means to strike back! We now have       Auriel's Bow. The gods themselves have favored us and we must answer       with action. The time has come to finally put an end to Harkon and his       unholy prophecy! We will march on their land and destroy those wretched       abominations so they can no longer corrupt our world! This is our fight       and this is our fate! This is the time of the Dawnguard!",
"Celann: Kill the abominations!",
"Isran: This is it!",
"Gunmar: Send them to Oblivion!",
"Sorine: Give him a crossbow bolt right between the eyes for me!",
"Durak: The prophecy is no more!",
"Isran: It's time we take the fight to their door. Gather your things and rest       well, my friend. We meet outside Castle Volkihar.",
"Garan: Auriel's Bow. Well done, indeed.Garan: Find Lord Harkon. Let him know the time of the prophecy is at hand.",
"Ronthil: I knew you would be victorious.Ronthil: Our lord will be most pleased, I'm sure. I knew you could do it.",
"Orthjolf: All of Skyrim will tremble before us.Orthjolf: Don't keep our master waiting. Take him the bow immediately.",
"Feran: You have the bow...Feran: I'm sure your reward will be great for ensuring our Lord's success.",
"Rargal: Who'll need thralls when the very sun is at our mercy?Rargal: Go find Lord Harkon. Tell him of your success.",
"Vingalmo: Auriel's power is ours!Vingalmo: I'm sure Lord Harkon will be most pleased with your efforts. Find          him at once.",
"Fura: Present the bow to Lord Harkon at once!",
"Hestla: You've served us all well, friend.Hestla: Auriel's Bow is ours. Deliver it to Lord Harkon at once, so we can reap        the benefits of this prophecy.",
"Harkon: • So, you've returned. Is your...pet keeping you entertained?        • Serana, my darling. I see you still favor keeping a pet.",
"Serana: You know why we're here.",
"Harkon: Of course I do. You disappoint me, Serana. You've taken everything I've        provided for you and thrown it all away for this",
"Serana: Provided for me? Are you insane? You've destroyed our family. You've        killed other vampires. All over some prophecy that we barely        understand. No more. I'm done with you. You will not touch him.",
"Harkon: So, I see this dragon has fangs. Your voice drips with the venom of        your mother's influence. How alike you've become.",
"Serana: No... Because unlike her, I'm not afraid of you. Not anymore.",
"Harkon: And you... It appears I have you to thank for turning my daughter        against me. I knew it was only a matter of time before",
"Dragonborn: • Loyalty? You never intended to let me live.            • Hatred born of your neglect.",
"Harkon: A small price to pay for the betterment of our kind.",
"Dragonborn: • You're an insult to our kind.            • Your kind is a blight on this world.",
"Harkon: • Oh, come now...spare me your notions of kinship. You've simply used        Serana in an attempt to take away what should rightfully be mine.",
"No, I'm here to prevent our annihilation.²        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Ah, I see you've been speaking to Valerica and she's convinced you         that eternal night will plunge us into war with daytime dwellers. If         only it were so. With the world in shadow, we would never tire, never         weaken...more than a match for their pitiful armies.",
"This is about more than killing vampires.²        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Ah, of course. The prophecy. You've come here to stop me from taking         Auriel's Bow and shrouding the world in darkness.",
"The bow belongs to me now.²        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Finally, a trace of honesty in our little conversation. How does it         feel to hold the fate of the vampire in your grasp? Exhilarating,         isn't it?",
"Enough of this!        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Yes, quite. I'm growing weary of speaking to you and my traitorous         daughter. I'll give you a single chance to turn over the bow to me.         There will not be a second.",
"Never.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯          Very well then, you leave me no choice!",
"Very well. (Give Auriel's Bow)         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Pitiful. Simply pitiful. I expected more from the defiant fool that          beguiled my daughter. No matter. Serana will sacrifice her blood for          the sake of the prophecy, and I will feast upon yours in Molag Bal's          honor!",
"Serana: Tough day for you!Serana: The bow! Use the bow!Serana: You can't hide from us!Serana: Sorry it had to be this way!Serana: This day was always coming!Serana: I still remember how to fight!",
"Harkon: No...Serana...your own father...",
"Serana: Well, now that's done.",
"Dragonborn: What will you do now?",
"Serana: I'm not sure.",
"Of course, if you've got any more adventures planned...",
"Garan: Lord Harkon, defeated. I never imagined I'd see the day. My lady, you       have my deepest sympathies. I am sure this was not easy for you.",
"Serana: He was out of control, Garan. It had to be done. I'm not happy about        this. He...he was still my father. But I suppose my father really died        a long time ago. This was just the end of something else.",
"Garan: Of course, my dear. All will be well now.",
"Garan: My congratulations on defeating Harkon. Clearly, you are the superior       vampire.",
"Fura Bloodmouth: None can deny your power now.",
"Hestla: No one will soon forget that you were the one to defeat Harkon.",
"Rargal: My lord.",
"Vingalmo: I am at your service, as always.",
"Dragonborn: Something on your mind, Garan?",
"Garan: Well, now that the Castle is yours, I was wondering. Would you be       interested in having the passage to the Courtyard restored? Harkon       clearly never cared much for it.",
"See to it at once.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        It would be my pleasure.",
"Stop wasting my time, Garan.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        My apologies. I shall not trouble you with it again.",
"Isran: It's over. He's dead, and the prophecy dies with him. I...I suppose this       is difficult for you.",
"Serana: I think my father really died a long time ago. This was just...the end        of something else. I did what needed to be done. Nothing more.",
"Isran: I think perhaps...I think you did more than that. You have my thanks.",
"Isran: So, the beast is destroyed. Not only that, but Auriel's Bow is in safe       hands. The Dawnguard will now be dedicated to safeguarding it, making       sure that prophecy will never come to pass. You've served Skyrim well.       Even with these vampires gone, the fight isn't completely over. Once       we're settled back in at the fort, there will be more work to do. We'd       be honored to have you join us.",
"Dragonborn: Harkon is dead.",
"Valerica: What? Are you certain?",
"Dragonborn: He died by my hand.",
"Valerica: Then I see nothing preventing my return to Tamriel. Allow me to          gather some of my things and I'll head back to Castle Volkihar. And          from the bottom of my heart, I thank you.",
"Dragonborn: What will you do now?",
"Valerica: Well, I think it's time I got back to my work as an alchemist. The          Soul Cairn will offer a unique opportunity to continue my studies,          and I intend to complete my research. In the meantime, if there are          any potions you might need, feel free to help yourself.",
"Dragonborn: Can you give me Bloodcursed Arrows?",
"Valerica: I'm sorry, I don't feel comfortable giving them to you. I understand          what you did for",
"Cultist: You there! You're the one they call Dragonborn?",
"Yes, I am Dragonborn.         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Your lies fall on deaf ears, Deceiver. The True Dragonborn comes...          You are but his shadow.",
"The Greybeards seem to think so...         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Then it is too late. The lie has already taken root in the hearts of          men. So we shall expose to them the falseness in their hearts by          tearing out yours, Deceiver!",
"When Lord Miraak appears all shall bear witness. None shall stand to         oppose him!",
"Gjalund: If you're looking for passage to Solstheim, too bad. I'm not going         back there anymore.",
"Are you the captain of the Northern Maiden?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Sure. Yeah. That's me. Why? Who sent you?",
"How can you not know how you got here? You sailed here, right?           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            (same as 'What happened? Why...')",
"What happened? Why won't you go back?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          It's hard to explain. I remember those people with the masks coming          on board, then... Next thing I remember, I was here and they were          gone. That's not right, losing whole days like that. There's been          something strange going on there for a while, but after this...I'm          done. I'm not going back to Solstheim.",
"Yes, you are. You're taking me to Solstheim.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Have you been listening to me? I'm not going back there.",
"You owe me. Those cultists you brought here tried to kill me.           (Persuade)² |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            • Alright, you have a point. Taking you back to find them is the              least I can do. Besides, maybe you can put a stop to whatever's              going on over there. I owe them a bit of payback myself.",
"People are trying to kill me. I'm not taking no for an answer.           (Intimidate)² |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            • Hold on, now. I'm just a simple sailor. I never wanted to get              mixed up in any of this. Alright, I'll take you. But we leave              immediately.",
"Solstheim? Where's that?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Surprised you've never heard of it. It's an island northeast of here.          Has a small dark elf town called Raven Rock and a handful of Nords          living in Skaal Village. But I'm not going back there. There's          something wrong with about that place.",
"Gjalund: Well, here we are. This is Raven Rock. Can't say I'm all that glad to         see it again. Good luck. Maybe you can figure out what's going on         around here.",
"Adril: I don't recognize you, so I'll assume this is your first visit to Raven       Rock, outlander. State your intentions.",
"Just looking for work.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        You've picked one of the worst places in Morrowind to do that, but suit        yourself.",
"None of your business.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        That's the kind of attitude that's going to land you in prison, but        I'll let it go for now.",
"Just remember, Raven Rock is sovereign territory of House Redoran. This       is Morrowind, not Skyrim. While you're here you will be expected to       abide by our laws. Any questions?",
"You know who Miraak is?²       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        I...I'm unsure. I swear I know the name, but cannot place it.",
"Can you tell me anything about him?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I don't think so. I'm not... The name has something to do with the         Earth Stone, I think. But I'm not sure what.",
"Why are you so suspicious of visitors?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        I have to be. As Second Councilor, the security of Raven Rock is my        primary concern.",
"Has security been an issue?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         This isn't exactly the city of Blacklight. We're on the frontier here,         and we've had more than a fair share of troubles. After all we've been         through together, I refuse to let Councilor Morvayn down.",
"What do your titles mean?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Councilor Morvayn is House Redoran's representative on Solstheim. As          second councilor, it's my job to support him and make certain his          rule is enforced.",
"What is the city of Blacklight?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          Your ignorance of our homeland doesn't surprise me. It's the capital          of Morrowind...been that way ever since Mournhold was sacked by the          Argonians. I don't visit there often anymore, but we still get the          occasional supply ship and visitors from there.",
"The Argonians invaded Morrowind?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Quite a while ago, yes. They cut a bloody swath across most of the           southern region of Morrowind. Nobody seems certain why it           happened...an attempt at expansion, revenge for the enslavement of           their people or perhaps both. Whatever the case may be, thousands           of Dunmer needlessly lost their lives and many more were exiled from           their homeland.",
"Raven Rock is purely a Dunmer settlement?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Raven Rock started out as an Imperial settlement, but the Empire chose        to abandon it just as my people were first setting foot here. They        left the town in shambles...but when House Redoran took over, we turned        it around and it became ours. And even if it's been a struggle to make        this island livable, we're proud to call it home.",
"Remember, we're watching you.",
"Neloth: You there... You don't seem to be in quite the same state as the others        here. Very interesting. May I ask what it is you're doing here?",
"Dragonborn: I'm looking for someone named Miraak.",
"Neloth: Miraak...Miraak... It sounds familiar, and yet I can't quite place...        Oh. Wait, I recall. But that makes very little sense. Miraak's been        dead for thousands of years.",
"Dragonborn: What does that mean?",
"Neloth: I'm not sure, but it is fascinating, isn't it? Perhaps it has some        relation to what's going on here. Quite unexpected. I'm afraid I can't        give you any answers. But there are ruins of an ancient temple of        Miraak's toward the center of the island. If I were you, I'd look        there.",
"What are these people doing?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Building something, clearly. And yet they don't seem to have much to         say about it. I'm very interested to find out what happens when they         finish.",
"Have you tried to stop this?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Certainly not! Doing so would interfere with whatever is going on, and         I would be unable to see how this all turns out.",
"What can you tell me about Morrowind?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         • When the city of Vivec was destroyed, it took decades for us to           rebuild. We are still but a shadow of our glorious past, but some           day we will rise again.",
"Frea: You there. What brings you to this place? Why are you here?",
"Dragonborn: Who are you?",
"Frea: I am Frea of the Skaal. I am here to either save my people, or avenge      them.",
"Dragonborn: Save them from what?",
"Frea: I am unsure. Something has taken control of most of the people of      Solstheim. It makes them forget themselves, and work on these horrible      creations that corrupt the Stones, the very land itself. My father Storn,      our shaman, says Miraak has returned to Solstheim, but that is      impossible.",
"Dragonborn: This Miraak tried to have me killed.",
"Frea: Then you and I both have reason to see what lies beneath us. Let us go.      There is nothing more I can do here. The Tree Stone and my friends are      beyond my help for now. We need to find a way into the temple below.",
"What do you know about Miraak?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       His story is as old as Solstheim itself. He served the dragons before       their fall from power, as most did. A priest in their order. But unlike       most, he turned against them. He made his own path, and his actions cost       him dearly. The stories say he sought to claim Solstheim for himself,       and the dragons destroyed him for it.",
"What is the Tree Stone?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       It is an ancient stone of power, a connection to the All-Maker. It       represents one of the aspects of nature, a part of the All-Maker's       creation. There are other stones around Solstheim. I fear for what has       happened to them...",
"Tell me of your people, the Skaal.      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       We have lived on Solstheim for many generations. Our people are tied to       the land itself. We try to serve the All-Maker, to live in balance with       nature, instead of exploiting it as others would.",
"You're here by yourself?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       There are few of us left unaffected by this curse. My father Storn, the       shaman, protects them in the village. I fashioned an amulet to guard me       against whatever has taken hold of the Skaal, but it is the only one of       its kind. If I cannot find a way to save them, there is no hope for our       people.",
"Frea: Are you ready to help me now? We should not delay. We should check these      rooms for supplies before heading further into the temple. We must be      careful in these ruins. Traps can be anywhere, and there will likely be      many. Miraak was trying to take power here, and protect himself in the      process.",
"Frea: I do not wish to imagine what kinds of things happened in this chamber.      Who were the poor souls trapped in these cages? What tortures did they      suffer at Miraak's hands? Was it in service to the dragons, or for his      own purposes? Look up there. I think I see something. The stairs are      knocked out. I have no doubt you can find your way up. You never know,      you may find something of value up there. I shall look around. We can      proceed when you are ready.",
"Frea: Impressive! Was it worth the effort?",
"Frea: I am not going down there. It would be foolish to attempt it. You have a      much better chance to make it through these traps. I have no doubt that      lever turns the blades off. I shall wait here for now.",
"Frea: Thank you. Miraak took great pains to make it difficult to reach him, it      seems. Let us hope that is the last of these traps.",
"Frea: The evil of this place must be rooted out. I do not know what it is      Miraak learned that gave him reason to turn on his masters. But his path      seems to have been a cruel one. I wonder if we will find some answers to      what happened so long ago.",
"Frea: How much deeper can this be? I had been told that Miraak's power was      great, but to have built so large a temple... It cannot be much further      now. I feel it in my bones.",
"Frea: Something feels wrong. Brace yourself!",
"Frea: Dead end? Impossible. There must be something more! Look around. I will      let you know if I find anything in the dining area.",
"Frea: I knew it! A secret passage in the dining area just opened up. This must      be it. Let us move quickly.",
"Frea: I wonder if there is something here that tells the story of Miraak...      Nothing but ruined books. I do not recognize this statuary. We passed by      a few of them earlier, but they are becoming more frequent as we get      further in. I do not like this place. It almost looks as if these statues      will come to life at any moment. It looks like there is only one way to      proceed. I leave the honor of pulling that handle to you. I do not want      to put my hand anywhere near the mouth of that statue.",
"Frea: It is eerily quiet. I do not suspect that will be the case the further we      go. Be on your guard.",
"Frea: There are dark magics at work here. Ready yourself. This book... It seems      wrong, somehow. Here, yet...not. It may be what we seek.",
"Miraak: The time comes soon when... What?",
"Miraak: Who are you to dare set foot here? Ah... You are Dragonborn. I can feel        it. And yet... You have done little beyond killing a few dragons. You        have no idea of the true power a Dragonborn can wield! Mul...Qah Diiv!        This realm is beyond you. You have no power here. And it is only a        matter of time before Solstheim is also mine. I already control the        minds of its people. Soon they will finish building my temple, and I        can return home. She can await my arrival with the rest of Tamriel.",
"Frea: What happened to you? You read the book and then... It seemed as though      you were not really here. I could see you, but also see through you!",
"Dragonborn: I'm not really sure. I saw Miraak on a dragon.",
"Frea: Where? Where is he? Can we reach him? Can we kill him?",
"Dragonborn: Somehow, reading this book took me to where he was.",
"Frea: This is a dangerous thing, then. We should return to my village, and show      this to my father. Perhaps Storn can make sense of what is going on.      Come, there looks to be a way out through here._____________________________¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|[DR03] THE FATE OF THE SKAAL |=================================================_____________________________|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯[Everyone escapes out into the fresh air. The Wind Stone's glow is nearby.]",
"Frea: You see that green light? That comes from the Wind Stone, where my      people work against their will. They must be freed soon. My village is      just ahead. Storn has used his magic to raise a barrier around it,      protecting the few of us left. That the barrier is still there is a good      sign.",
"Frea: Father! I have returned! There is yet hope!",
"Storn: Frea! What news do you bring? Is there a way to free our people?",
"Frea: No, but I have brought someone who has seen things... He has confirmed      that Miraak is the one behind the suffering of our people.",
"Storn: I feared that it would be so.",
"Frea: But how is that possible? After all this time...",
"Storn: I fear there is much we do not yet know.",
"Frea: Please, tell Storn what has happened.",
"Storn: So, you have seen things, yes? My magic grows weak, and so does the       barrier around our village. Time is short. Tell me what you know.",
"Miraak is behind what's happening to your people.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        How do you know this?",
"Dragonborn: I read a book in Miraak's temple, and went somewhere. Miraak was            there.",
"Storn: The legends speak of that place. Terrible battles fought at the temple.       The dragons burning it to the ground in rage. They speak also of       something worse than dragons buried within. Difficult to imagine, but       if true... It means what I feared has come to pass. Miraak was never       truly gone, and now has returned. If you could go to this place and see       him... Are you like Miraak? Are you Dragonborn?",
"Miraak did claim to be Dragonborn.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        That is what the stories say. You are Dragonborn as well, then. Perhaps        you are connected.",
"Dragonborn: What does it mean if we're both Dragonborn?",
"Storn: I am unsure. It may mean that you could save us, or it may mean that you       could bring about our destruction. But our time is running out. The few       of us left free of control cannot protect ourselves for much longer.       You must go to Saering's Watch. Learn there the Word Miraak learned long       ago, and use that knowledge on the Wind Stone. You may be able to break       the hold on our people there, and free them from control.",
"What do you know about Miraak?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Much of what was known has been lost to the ages. He was Dragonborn,        and yet he served the dragons. A priest in their order, highly esteemed        and very powerful. Then he turned against them, becoming something they        feared. He was defeated long ago, but it seems he was never destroyed.",
"What do you mean, 'free your people from control?'       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Some dark influence wields power over them, forces them to forget        themselves and act against their nature. At first it was only during        the night, but now every moment is spent building some strange shrine        around the Wind Stone. I believe if the shrine can be destroyed, the        Skaal will be free once more.",
"Why do I need to learn a Word of Power?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Miraak is behind what's happening to our village, and so the knowledge        he has gained as Dragonborn is at the heart of it. You are Dragonborn        as well. You too can wield this power, perhaps to a better end.",
"All-Maker shelter you.",
"Storn: The air is different. We are safe, which means you have succeeded.",
"Dragonborn: Your people are free.",
"Storn: So it is. You have proven yourself an ally to the Skaal, and so the       Skaal shall be allies to you.",
"Dragonborn: What do we do now?",
"Storn: If you have released the Wind Stone and broken the hold on my people,       perhaps you can do the same for the rest of Solstheim. I doubt it will       fully stop whatever Miraak is doing, but it may slow his progress.",
"Dragonborn: That's not enough. I need to stop Miraak now.",
"Storn: I cannot help with that. None here can. You will need the knowledge       Miraak himself learned. You will need to learn more about this Black       Book.",
"Dragonborn: Tell me more about this book, then.",
"Storn: Miraak had this? This does not look like something of the Dragon cult.       It is a dark thing, unnatural. I would have nothing to do with it. But       the Dark Elf Wizard, Neloth... He came to us sometime ago, asking about       the Black Books. I believe he knows a great deal about them. Perhaps too       much. Seek him to the south. Be cautious, Dragonborn. There is something       else at work here.____________________________¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|[DR04] CLEANSING THE STONES |==================================================____________________________|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ [This quest is just the player destroying the other shrines. There isn't much to speak of, unfortunately.]",
"Varona: Why are you out here? Aren't you supposed to be in the tower assisting        Master Neloth?",
"Talvas: Why won't this summoning work? If you must know, I'm trying to get this        Ash Guardian spell to work. Now let me concentrate. Besides, shouldn't        you be worrying about the damage to the tower?",
"Varona: Master Neloth has tasked Elynea with repairing the tower. Why aren't        you doing this in the lab, where it would be safer for all of us?",
"Talvas: The, uh...the lab is too small. Also, I need the ashy soil. Master        Neloth knows what I'm doing. No need to bother him about it though.        He's quite busy at the moment",
"Varona: It's on your head if something goes wrong. Just let me get back inside        first.",
"Talvas: No Ash Guardian. Maybe the book has something.",
"Varona: We don't get many visitors. Is there something you need?",
"What is this place?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Tel Mithryn. It's the home of Master Neloth. You may have heard of         him. He's a famous Telvanni wizard.",
"He lives in a giant mushroom?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          In Morrowind, the Telvanni grow buildings from special fungus spores.          Master Neloth grew one here to be his home. Don't ask me how.",
"Are you one of Neloth's apprentices?         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯          No. Talvas is his apprentice. I'm his steward. I manage the day to          day¹ affairs of Tel Mithryn.",
"Who else lives here?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Talvas is Master Neloth's apprentice. If you are interested in spells,         he might be willing to sell you some. Elynea is our alchemist. She         specializes in mushrooms and other types of fungus. Ulves runs the         kitchens.",
"Neloth: You again? Didn't I see you in Raven Rock?",
"Dragonborn: I hear you know where to find Black Books.",
"Neloth: You refer to the tomes of esoteric knowledge that old Hermaeus Mora        has scattered throughout the world? Is this somehow connected to your        search for Miraak?",
"The Black Books have something to do with Hermaeus Mora?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         You didn't know? Hmm, I thought it was obvious. Hermaeus Mora has         always tried to seduce mortals into his service with the lure of         forbidden knowledge. Where the Black Books actually came from...no one         really knows. Some appear to have been written far in the past, others         might be from the future. Apparently time is more malleable if you're         the Daedric Prince of fate and destiny.",
"Who is Hermaeus Mora?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         If you have to ask that, you'd probably be best leaving his books to         wiser heads than yours. Like all Daedric Princes, he's not to be         trifled with. But he is subtler than most of his ilk, appropriate for         the prince of knowledge and fate. Many scholars and loremasters have         been ensnared by the lure of learning secrets that only Hermaeus Mora         possesses. But don't worry. I have no intention of joining them in         their endless search though the infinite halls of Apocrypha.",
"Dragonborn: I have to know what Miraak knows if I want to stop him.",
"Neloth: Now that is a dangerous path indeed. Hermaeus Mora gives nothing away        for free. You may end up like Miraak, of course. Two power-mad        Dragonborn. It could be very interesting.",
"Dragonborn: Do you know where I can find another Black Book?",
"Neloth: Oh yes. They're not hard to locate once you know how to look for them.        I have one here that I've been using to locate more.",
"Dragonborn: You have a Black Book?",
"Neloth: Yes. I haven't been idle while this fascinating madness engulfed        Solstheim. But my book isn't what you're looking for. I'm quite sure        it's unconnected with this Miraak. But I do know where to find a Black        Book that can help you.",
"So you know where to find this Black Book? The one connected with        Miraak? |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Yes, I do. I haven't been able to get it, though. But maybe together         we can unlock the secrets the Dwemer left behind.",
"The Dwemer? What do they have to do with this?          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           Forbidden knowledge was somewhat of a specialty of the dwarves, eh?           You don't think they would just leave it alone, do you?",
"Just tell me where the book is and I'll go get it.          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯           I'm afraid it isn't that simple. If it was, I would have the book           already.",
"It seems the ancient Dwemer discovered this book and took it to          study. I found their 'reading room' in the ruins of Nchardak. The          book is there, but it's sealed in a protective case which I wasn't          able to open. But perhaps the two of us together will be able to get          at the book. To Nchardak, then. Follow me.",
"Why won't the book you have here help me?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Oh, it is clearly not associated with the same power that has         overtaken the island. And I'm not talking about Hermaeus Mora. These         Black Books are all his, of course. No, what you're looking for is a         specific book. Presumably because Miraak's power derives from it.",
"Neloth: The Dwemer certainly know how to build for the ages. These towers have        outlasted their creators by millenia¹. The book is housed inside that        dome. I'll need to unlock the door for us. Let's get on with it.",
"Neloth: I had to clean out the riff-raff last time I was here, too. Where do        they come from?",
"Neloth: The Dwemer of Nchardak appear to have been fond of these control        pedestals. Luckily I found a cube to operate it inside on my last        visit. I sealed the door when I left to keep out ignorant meddlers.        Let me unlock it. The book is just inside.",
"Neloth: You can see the book right there. So tantalizingly close...but trust        me, no magic will open that. I'd have had the book already if it could.        No, we'll have to do this the hard way. If we can restore the steam        supply to this room, I'm certain I can open it. As you'll see, that's        easier said than done. This way to the boilers. Follow me.",
"Neloth: The last time I was here, I only explored a small portion of the ruins.        I was here alone then, and I find an assistant is absolutely essential        for this kind of dirty, dangerous work. Nchardak. The 'City of a        Hundred Towers'. In its day, it was the largest of the great Dwemer        Archives, and perhaps the most advanced. In the old stories, when the        Nords came to conquer it, it's said the Dwemer submerged the entire        city beneath the sea until the invaders gave up. I have my doubts. But        the city was a marvel of Dwemer engineering. Now...reduced to this. As        you can see, most of the lower levels of the city are flooded. But it        isn't hopeless -- the old Dwemer pumps still seem to work. Watch.",
"Neloth: But the pumps only operate when a cube is in the pedestal. And        unfortunately, I only have one cube. These four boilers provide steam        to the room upstairs. They're shut down, but they still respond to the        control cubes. So, if we can find four more cubes, we can turn these        boilers back on and restore steam power to the room upstairs. Then I        should be able to open the book's protective case. Bring that cube.        We'll need it.",
"Neloth: Yes...here we are. This device shows the location of four more cubes        in this section of the city. It looks like most of the cubes were moved        to the lower levels; perhaps to try to control the flooding before the        city was abandoned. Interesting. That would suggest that the city must        have originally sunk during the first cataclysm of Red Mountain. Or        that the Dwemer's servitors continued to try to preserve the city after        their creators' disappearance.",
"Neloth: Three of the cubes are through here. This seems like a sensible place        to start. You should be able to unseal this door with the control cube        I gave you.",
"Neloth: I hope the rest of the cubes arethis easy to find. Although knowing the        Dwemer, I rather doubt it.",
"Neloth: These must be the 'Great Workshops of Nchardak'. Impressive even in        ruins. In the city's days of glory, it was reputed to be able to        assemble a complete automaton in a single day. Much of the Dwemer army        at the Battle of Red Mountain must have come from here. It looks like        we'll need to lower the water level to make any more progress.",
"Neloth: Ah, good. Now we can see if we can find a way to get that next cube.",
"Neloth: There seems to be an inexhaustible suply of these Dwemer contraptions.",
"Neloth: Unfortunately, each cube we retrieve shuts down the corresponding        pumps, raising the water level. We'll have to be careful.",
"Neloth: Let's see where this leads. With the water level this high, we can swim        right across the collapsed part of the passage and reach the other        side.",
"Neloth: Very good. By my count, we've found a total of four cubes. Assuming        you haven't dropped any anywhere.",
"Neloth: You'll need to lower the water level before we can proceed any further.",
"Neloth: The last cube is somewhere in here. I hope it won't require more        swimming around in this filth. I'd guess that must be the pump        activator up there. But how to reach it? We'll need to get all three        of these bridges down in order to reach the pump control.",
"Neloth: That's it! Don't touch anything else. Quickly now.",
"Neloth: What a mess. I'm getting tired of wading around in this muck. I have        an idea. I'll wait here and retrieve this cube once you find the last        one we need. Good luck!",
"Neloth: Do you have the cube? Good, good! Then I'll take this cube and we can        be on our way. Watch out. The water's rising even higher with both        pumps shut down. That was easier than I expected. I'm glad you were        here to do all the hard work. With the cube I retrieved from the        pumping pedestal, we should now have five cubes -- exactly what we        need. Now we can finally see about getting those boilers started.",
"Neloth: You'll need the cube I picked up to start all the boilers. Here, I        picked this up this cube for you.",
"Neloth: That seems to have done it. Good. It took longer than I'd hoped, but        at least it's finally done. Look out, another Steam Centurion!",
"Neloth: I'm going to head back upstairs and see if the reading room has steam.        If so, it should be a simple matter to release the book.",
"Neloth: Yes, it worked! The steam is flowing. Now it should be as simple as...        That should do it.",
"Neloth: At last. I hope it was worth it. Please...be my guest. You deserve the        first look. Besides, it could be very dangerous. These books are known        to drive many people insane.",
"Neloth: Oh good. Be sure to say hello to Hermaeus Mora for me, if you see him.",
"Hermaeus Mora: • So, another seeker after knowledge enters my realm.               • I know you, champion. The Oghma Infinium was only the                 beginning.",
"This is Apocrypha, where all knowledge is hoarded.",

"Don't worry, I was just leaving.²               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                No. Not yet. I have watched your progress through my realm with                growing interest. You are following in the footsteps of my                servant, Miraak. Like him, you are Dragonborn, and seek the                power that is your birthright.",

"The Skaal have withheld their secrets from me for many long               years. The time has come for this knowledge to be added to my               library.",
"What if the Skaal refuse to give up their secrets?                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                 My servant Miraak would have found a way to bring me what I                 want. So will you, if you wish to surpass him.",

"Why do I need this Word of Power to defeat Miraak?               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                Even dragons submit to Miraak's Voice. Without that power, you                cannot face him. So say I, Hermaeus Mora, master of the tides                of Fate.",
"Isn't Miraak your ally? Why help me defeat him?               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                He has served me long and well. But he grows restless under my                guidance. His desire to return to your world will spread my                influence more widely. But it will also set him free from my                direct control. It may be time to replace him with a more loyal                servant.

"Dragonborn: He wants the 'secrets of the Skaal' in exchange for teaching me            the third Word.",
"Neloth: Hmph. What secrets could they have worth keeping from old Mora? Sounds        like a bargain to me. Hermaeus Mora learns some fascinating new ways to        skin a horker, and you become the second most powerful Dragonborn that        ever lived. Well, that gives me a lot to think about. I need to get        back to Tel Mithryn. I have some ideas about how to locate more of        these Black Books...",
"Krosulhah: When Miraak returns, all will bow before him!",
"Miraak: This dragon's soul belongs to me. One step closer to my return.",
"Dragonborn: I spoke to Hermaeus Mora. He asked for the 'secrets of the Skaal.'",
"Storn: Hermaeus Mora...old Herma-Mora himself. So he is the source of Miraak's       power. Of course. We have many tales of Herma-Mora trying to trick us       into giving up our secrets to him. And now he comes again for what we       have long kept from him.",
"He said that's the only way he'll teach me the final Word of Miraak's       Shout. |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        So it falls to me to be the one to give up our secrets to our ancient        enemy. I do not know if I have the strength to face him. The Tree Stone        is still corrupted...the land is still out of balance. But with the        other five restored...it may be enough. It will have to be.",
"You mean you'll give him what he wants?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Yes. The Skaal also tell of the day when we must finally give up our         secrets. When Herma-Mora finally wins. As shaman, it is my duty to         guard these secrets, but also to decide when it is necessary to give         them up. I believe that time is now. If I am wrong, may my ancestors         forgive me. Give me the book. I will read it, and speak to old         Herma-Mora myself. I will make sure he lives up to his part of the         bargain.",
"What are the 'secrets of the Skall'?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Ancient lore, handed down from shaman to shaman since the All-Maker        first gave Solstheim to the Skaal. How to talk to the wind, how to        listen to the earth -- these are our secrets. Nothing of power or        mastery.",
"Why would Hermaeus Mora want your secrets?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         We know him as Herma-Mora, the Demon of Knowledge. It is in his nature         to hoard secrets for himself. Their value to him is of no consequence.         The very fact that the Skaal have kept knowledge from him has merely         increased his desire to have it.",
"Herma-Mora? Why do you call him that?       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        That is our name for him -- the Demon of Knowledge. He has always been        our enemy.",
"Dragonborn: I hope you know what you're doing. (Give book)",
"Storn: That is my hope as well. I am trusting that you will make this sacrifice       worthwhile.",
"Frea: Father, you must not do this. That book is...wrong. Evil. Against      everything that you have taught me my whole life.",
"Storn: I must, Frea. It is the only way to free Solstheim forever from Miraak's       shadow. There comes a time when everything must change. Nothing that       lives remains the same forever. Do not fear for me, my daughter. This is       the destiny that the All-Maker has laid out for me.",
"Frea: I stand beside you, father, as always.",
"Storn: I am ready for whatever the foul master of this book has in store for       me.",
"Hermaeus Mora: At last, the Skaal yield up their secrets to me.",
"Frea: Father! No, stop!",
"Storn: You...liar...gah!...I won't...not...for you...",
"Frea: Do something!",
"Hermaeus Mora: Dragonborn, you have delivered me the gift I requested. In               return, I keep my promise, as befits a Prince of Oblivion: I               give you the Word of Power that you need to challenge Miraak.               You will be either a worthy opponent or his successor, as the               tides of fate decree.",
"Storn: Nooo...",
"Frea: Father! What have you done? Go. My father sacrificed himself so that you      could destroy Miraak and lift his master's shadow from the land. Go,      then. Kill Miraak. Do not fail.",
"Fanari Strong-Voice: Goodbye, old friend. We will miss you, but do not worry.                     Frea will guide us well, thanks to you.",
"Edla: We won't forget what you did for us, Storn Crag-Strider. Walk with the      All-Maker.",
"Deor Woodcutter: Frea...I'm sorry.",
"Aeta: It can't be...please, All-Maker, send him back to us...",
"Finna: May the All-Maker guide your soul to the next life.",
"Nikulas: Frea...what happened? What was that thing? I thought the village was         safe now.",
"Wulf Wild-Blood: Return to the All-Maker, old one. The Skaal will never forget                 your sacrifice.",
"Morwen: I don't really understand what you did, but I trust you did it for the        good of the village. So...thank you.",
"Tharstan: By the gods...I've never seen anything like it...I, uh...I don't          think this will go in my book.",
"Sahrotaar: Hail, thuri. Your thu'um has the mastery. Climb aboard and I will           carry you to Miraak.",
"Sahrotaar: Beware. Miraak is strong. He knew you would come here.",
"Miraak: Sahrotaar, are you so easily swayed?",
"Miraak: No. Not yet. We should greet our guest first. And so the First        Dragonborn meets the Last Dragonborn at the summit of Apocrypha. No        doubt just as Hermaeus Mora intended. He is a fickle master, you know.        But now I will be free of him. My time in Apocrypha is over. You are        here in your full power, and thus subject to my full power. You will        die. And with the power of your soul, I will return to Solstheim and        be master of my own fate once again. Kruziikrel! Relonikiv! Now!",
"Miraak: So easily you betray me, after all these years.",
"Miraak: Kruziikrel, ziil los dii du!",
"Miraak: Relonikiv, ziil los dii du!",
"Miraak: Fate decreed that you had to die so that I could win my freedom.",
"Miraak: Sahrotaar, ziil los dii du!",
"Hermaeus Mora: Did you think to escape me, Miraak? You can hide nothing from me               here. No matter. I have found a new Dragonborn to serve me.",
"Miraak: May he be rewarded for her service as I am!",
"Hermaeus Mora: Miraak harbored fantasies of rebellion against me. Learn from               his example. Serve me faithfully, and you will continue to be               richly rewarded.",
"Frea: I can feel it. The Tree Stone is free again. The Oneness of the land is      is restored. Does that mean...is it over? Is Miraak defeated?",
"It's over. Miraak is dead.      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Then my father's sacrifice...it was not in vain. He died to free us.       Tell me...was it the only way? Did he need to die?",
"Hermaeus Mora killed Storn, remember. Not Miraak.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        I know. The Skaal will not forget this. Storn's death will become        another of the many tales of Herma-Mora's treachery.",
"Hermaeus Mora wouldn't have helped me without Storn's sacrifice.       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        Yes, his 'help' which did not require him to kill my father. Such is        the way of Herma-Mora, the eternal enemy of the Skaal.",
"Storn didn't die for nothing. Miraak will never threaten Solstheim again.      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       Thank you. Whatever your other reasons for acting, you have done the       Skaal a great service. We will not forget what you've done.",
"One more thing, Skaal-friend, if you will. I know it is not my place,      but...may I offer a word of advice...of warning?",
"Sure, what is it?      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯       As shaman of the Skaal, I am charged with the spiritual well-being of       my people. While you are not of the Skaal, you are Skall-friend, and so       I give you this warning. Herma-Mora forced you to serve him in order to       defeat Miraak. Do not let him lure you further down that path. The       All-Maker made you Dragonborn for a higher purpose. Do not forget that.       Walk with the All-Maker, Skaal-friend.",
"Neloth: Hold still. Let me get a good look at you.",
"Dragonborn: What are you looking for?",
"Neloth: Incipient madness. Loss of self-awareness. Black spots in the whites        of the eyes. Any of the documented indications of Hermaeus Mora's        permanent influence. Hmm, no, you look fine. Well, at least no        different than when I first saw you.",
"Don't you want to know what happened with Miraak?        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         Who? Oh him. Well, I assume you killed him. Or Hermaeus Mora turned on         him when you looked like the winning bet. Or a bit of both.",
"You don't need to worry about me.        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         I wasn't worried. Just interested. I don't get to observe first-hand         many people who've spoken to Hermaeus Mora.",

"He's your brother.",
"He is always bugging me about my house. Fifteen years ago we agreed that house belongs to me. Now the value of the house is going up and he's seeing dollar signs. Everything goes wrong at once. Nobody wants to help me and I'm dying.",

"Look, don't worry about it. You just concentrate on getting well .",
"Well at least you have a good man.",
"You're wrong, mom. He's not what you think he is. He didn't get his promotion, and he got drunk last night and he hit me.",
"Johhny doesn't drink. What are you talking about?",
"He did last night, and I don't love him anymore.",
"Johnny is your financial security. You can't afford to ignore this .",

Johnny is very caring about the people in his life, and he gave Billy his own set of keys to our place. Billy has a thing for Johnny, but I don't like it, so we try to discourage it.",

"Ok , mom .",
"Bye, bye.",
"Hey Billy.",
"Jimmy! I've been looking for you.",
"Yeah, sure you have. You have my money right.",
"Yeah it's coming. It'll be here in a few minutes.",

"It's coming! It's coming!",
"Where's my fucking money Billy?",
"Put the gun down!",

"Over there! All of you, over there! NOW!",
"Say your prayers wienerheads, because I'm about to make some Swiss cheese out of YOU!",
"Do you know who I am? I have 9 black belts, 15 Master's degrees and a PhD in Agricultural Economics. That's right, you know I'm way better than you, and all my friends will gladly tell you just how great and awesome I am! Have you seen my power level? It's over 9,000! You know what that means? It means I have more than 9,000 units of POWER. It also puts my total adjusted force rating at 22,000! That's more than triple, so you don't want to make me mad, because anger is my middle name!",

"Nothing !",

"What do you need money for?",
"Mom please! Billy is with me and Johnny!",

"Mom.",
"What, were you a hooker, call boy, a kerb crawler? Where in the hell did you meet that man!?",

"Of course it won't. I made him.... go away.",
"Are we still going to the movie tonight?",
"Oh, sure we are.",
"What kind of movie are we going to see. Vampires?",
"Well we'll see. .. .Billy, don't plan too much, it may not come",
"Alright, let's toss the ball around.",
"Okay .",
"Shoot Billy.",
"Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"It's about me and you.",
"Go on .",
"You're just so cool and such a nice, caring guy. Everybody likes you and only a fat, stupid, idiotic, selfish jerk with a body odor problem would ever betray you. You help so many people and you've been so good to me.",
"Go on .",
"Billy, don’t worry about that. Lisa and I love you too, as a person, as a human being, as a friend. You know people don't have to say it, they can feel it.",
"What do you mean?",
"You can love someone deep inside your heart and there is nothing wrong with it. If a lot of people love each other, the world will be a better place to live.",
"But you're Lisa's future husband.",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Billy, don't worry about it. The important thing is that you appreciate loyalty. You would never betray me and that's why I do things like pay your rent for you. In fact, and this is a secret, I have a small fortune built up that I'm waiting to give away as a reward to all my friends who never betray me.",
"You mean you are not upset at me?",
"No, because I trust you and I trust Lisa, and Mark. You are part of our family and we love you very much, as a friend.",
"But you are sort of like our son too, and we will help you anytime .",
"Well, you're right. Thanks for paying my tuition.",
"You're very welcome Billy. Keep in mind that if you have any problems, talk to me and I will help you.",
"Awesome. Thanks Johnny.",
"Let's go eat, huh. Come on, let's go. (JOHNNY AND BILLY WALK TO EXIT THE ROOF.)",
"You must be starving.",

"Would you like something to drink?",
"What do you have?",
"Vodka, brandy, rum, tequila, applejack, vermouth, cognac, gin, and the whiskeys: bourbon, scotch, rye and Canadian. I would go with the rum because it's 151 proof.",
"Hit me with a double!",
"Let's get this party started! (THEY LAUGH.)",
"How's Johnny?",
"Not so good. He didn't get his promotion.",
"Quite a bit. He got drunk last night and hit me. Now he's on the roof trying to give advice to Billy.",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"He hit you!?? How did that happen?",
"He got drunk and didn't know what he was doing.",
"You poor thing. Are you okay?",
"Well, I don't want to marry him anymore.",
"What??? I thought it was all planned. How is he in bed?",
"He's okay, but I found somebody else.",
"What!?? And you're planning a birthday party for Johnny?",
"Why not? He doesn’t know anything about it.",
"Pretty good, huh?",
"Look, this is not right. You are living with a one guy and doing sex with another.",
"Does this new guy know Johnny?",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"He's his best friend who lives in this building.",
"It's Mark, isn't it! You're not thinking about Johnny or Mark. You're just thinking about yourself, Lisa. You can't go on this way. Somebody's going to get hurt. You have to be honest with Johnny. You can't go on like this.",
"Oh, so you're saying you are thinking about him and not yourself? Well if you care so much for him, then why cheat on him?",
"Look I really don't know what to do. I love Mark. I really don't have any more feelings for Johnny.",
"Johnny is so excited about this wedding.",
"You've got to tell Johnny.",
"No guilt trips .",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"You don't feel guilty about this at all?",
"No , I'm happy .",
"Something awful is going to happen.",
"Please don't tell anybody.",
"Don't worry, you can trust me. You're secret is safe with me.",
"It's between us women.",
"Hi Johnny.",
"Well I guess I'd better be going. I'll just talk to you guys later? Excuse me.",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Lisa, remember what I told you.",
"What's she talking about?",
"It's women talk. Only women can talk about it!",
"Are you sure about that? Maybe I'll change my mind.",
"Don't talk like that. What do you mean?",
"What do you think? Women change their minds all the time.",
"Ha, ha! You must be kidding, aren't you?",
"Look, I don't want to talk about it. I'm going to go upstairs, wash up and go to bed.",
"How dare you talk to me like that! You should tell me everything! What is it you don't want to talk about?",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Why Lisa! Why Lisa! Why don't you talk to me! Come on Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! Talk to me please! Without you I would be nothing. You are my life, my everything, I could not go on without you Lisa.",
"You're scaring me.",
"You are lying! I never hit you. You are taking me apart, Lisa! ! ! ! !",
"Why are you so hysterical!?",
"Do you understand life? Do you understand life? Do you?",
"Don't worry about it. Everything will be alright.",
"You drive me crazy!",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Goodnight, Johnny.",
"Don't worry about it, I still love you. Good night Lisa.",
"You look really tired today mom, are you feeling okay?",
"Why not? What's wrong?",
"You remember my friend Shirley Hamilton? She wants to buy a new house and I asked Johnny if he could help her with the down payment. All he can tell me is that it's an awkward situation. I expected your husband to be a little more generous .",
"He's not my husband.",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Mom, I don't love Johnny anymore. I don't even like him. I had sex with someone else.",
"You can't be serious.",
"You don't understand.",
"Who, who is it?",
"Oh no! It's that homework character with the underwear, isn't it! I gave you strict orders not to sleep with that goof ball. Well, that's it. You leave me no other option than to disown",
"It's not Bran! Look, I just don't want to talk about it.",
"You don't want to talk about it. Then why did you bring it up in the first place? Have you lost your mind? Next thing you'll be turning tricks like your brother.",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"You don't know? You really are going crazy.",
"Mom, just take the medicine and you'll be fine. Are you coming to the party?",
"Sure, I suppose so.",
"How can they say this about me? I don't believe it. Lisa has been unfaithful and that woman, her mother, cares more about her 'life threatening' cancer than she does about me.",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Hey Johnny, what's going on?",
"Oh hi Bran, what's new?",
"Actually Johnny, I got a little bit of a tragedy on my hands.",
"Did Michelle betray you or something?",
"No, nothing horrible like that! I'd probably kill myself if she ever did that.",
"Who wouldn't? So tell me what happened.",
"Me and Michelle were making out, at your place.",
"Uh huh.",
"And Lisa and Claudette sort of walked in on us in the middle of it. That's not the end of the story.",
"Go on, I'm listening.",
"We're going at it and I get out of there as fast as possible. I get my pants, I get my shirt, and I get out of there. And then about half way down the stairs, I realize that I had misplaced, I had forgotten something ... .my underwear.",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Underwear?",
"So I come back to get it, you know, and I pretend that I need a book, you know I'm looking for my book. I reach in and put the underwear in my pocket and it sort of slides out, and Claudette, she saw it sticking out of my pocket, and she pulls it out and she's showing everybody me underwears.",
"You must be kidding. Underwear, I got the picture.",
"Underwear, that's life.",
"Hey Billy.",
"Do you guys want to play some football?",
"Oh come on !",
"What's the matter Bran, are you chicken? CHIP! CHIP!!!",

"Ha Ha! CHIP! ! ! CHIP! ! ! !",
"Ha Ha! Oh hi Mark!",
"Okay guys , whatever .",
"Hey what's up Mark?",
"Hey Billy, what's up?",
"Let ' s go for it .",
"Sorry you had to see that.",

"Studying right? I don't study like that.",
"Catch it.",
"What's going on you guys?",
"He's just telling us about an underwear issue.",
"Underwear? What's that?",
"It's embarrassing man. I don't want to get into it.",
"Underwear .... It ' s the underpants man!",
"Does anyone know CPR?",

"Are you okay?",
"Sure?",
"Uh huh.",
"Do you want to go see a doctor?",
"No, no, no. I'm good, I'm alright. I'm fine.",
"Yeah Mark, take him to a doctor, and Bran, listen if you need anything call me anytime alright. We are very good friends and I will do everything in my power to help you get better.",
"Take care of him Mark!",
"Oh man.... oh man, oh man.",

"Oh hi Peter, I'm so glad you stopped by. Come in and have a seat. I'll get some water for us to drink.",
"Of course I do . I'm a psychologist. What's the problem?",
"They never say what they mean, and they always play games. (JOHNNY HANDS PETER A GLASS OF WATER.)",
"Okay, what do you mean?",
"Lisa? Are you sure?",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"This is Lisa we are talking about?",
"Yeah .",
"Are you sure?",
"Yes .",
"What would you like me to say?",
"You are a psychologist, Peter. Don't you have some advice?",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"It's not about love, Johnny. It's about control, and the best way to control a female is to make them emotionally dependent on you. You didn't do that, so Lisa found it somewhere else.",
"Did you hear the door?",
"Yeah .",
"Oh hey Johnny. Hey Peter.",
"We are just talking about women.",
"Women, man, women just confuse me. Can’t live with them, can't live without them, but we need them for baby making.",
"Why didn't you mention this before? I'm a psychologist. Is it anyone I know?",
"What do you mean, is it someone you know?",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Can I meet her?",
"Why would you want to do that, Johnny? I mean, well, um, what would Lisa think? It's an awkward situation.",
"Oh I see. You mean she's too old or you think I will take her away from you? Huh?",
"No!",
"Tell me about your problems Johnny.",
"Peter, you always play psychologist with us.",
"Look, I may be your friend, but by profession I am a psychologist, and that makes me an expert on these issues.",
"Lisa is teasing me about whether we will get married or not, and we haven't made love in awhile. I don't know what to do.",
"What kind of man are you Johnny? People are people. Sometimes they can't see their own faults, so they need someone to tell them. You have to give it to her straight. It takes two to tango Johnny, and if all she has are two left feet she'll just end up stepping all over your toes. You're going to get hurt .",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Hey I'm thinking of moving to a better place man. I'm making some good money.",
"Look, you should tell her the truth. You are doing this for your girl, right?",
"You are right Peter! Is she getting a divorce Mark?",
"You guys are too much! Hey, are you running Bay to Breakers this year?",
"No, I'm not going this year.",
"Ha, ha!! Chicken Peter, you are just a little chicken!!! Chip!!! Chip!!! Chip!!!! Chip!!!!! Chip!!!!",
"Ha Ha! ! Squeak! ! ! Squeak! ! ! ! Honk! ! ! Little Chicken! ! !",
"Who are you guys calling a chicken? I just don't like all the weirdos. There's too many weirdos.",
"How about the one with the bridal gown and the sign?",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Oh yeah, 'Please Marry Me'. I almost took her up on it.",
"The barbecue chicken and rice was delicious. That was cool.",
"You guys proved my point. You are both weird. You guys want to play cards?",
"No, we can't. I expect Lisa any minute.",
"Hey, who's king of the house?",
"Yeah, you have to establish these guidelines before you get married. How did you meet Lisa? you never told us.",
"It's a very interesting story. When I moved to San Francisco I had two suitcases and I didn't know anyone. I hit the YMCA with a two thousand dollar check that I couldn't cash.",
"Why not?",
"Because it was an out of state bank. Anyway, I was working as a bus boy in a hotel and Lisa was sitting, drinking her coffee and she was so beautiful, and I say hi to her. That's how we met.",
"So, what's the interesting part?",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Oh give us a break Mark! Isn't it obvious? A two thousand dollar out of state bank issued check that he can't cash? Ha Ha Ha! That's quite the conundrum. I'll bet it's never been cashed, has it.",
"You're right Peter, on both counts. I had the uncashed check laminated and placed in a photo album, which is indeed very interesting. But, even more interesting is that Lisa was living in San Francisco at the time.",
"So?",
"Don't you see, Mark? Lisa had her own home in the city. She did not need to stay in a hotel. She had some kind of inexplicable urge to spend the night in that very hotel, during my shift. It was meant to be!",
"What, no tips from your job?",
"Whatever, do you guys want to eat something?",
"Hey guys. What's going on?",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Oh, hey Lisa.",
"Hey Lisa.",
"Where's Johnny?",
"He's in the kitchen. I got to go.",
"Are you crazy? I have to be at work early. See ya.",
"Why are you sitting on the floor Billy?",
"It's hard to explain, you wouldn't understand.",
"You son of a bitch!!! What the hell is the matter with you!? You're the reason I drink! If you don't get up this instant I'm going to belt whip you so hard you'll wish you were going to the moon!",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Will you tell him I said hello?",
"Alright! ! !",
"Yes !",
"Oh, hi Mark. What's happening?",
"Hi Peter.",
"This is a good place to think, huh?",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"What's that?",
"No man. You know I don't smoke that stuff. You look depressed.",
"Why don't you tell me about it?",
"Well, I feel like running, or killing myself. Something crazy like that.",
"Why are you smoking that crap? No wonder you can't think straight. That stuff will mess up your brain.",
"Anyway, it's none of your business. Why are you so nosy? You think you know everything. You don't know shit.",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Just a minute. Who do you think you are? You're acting like a kid. Grow up.",
"Who are you calling a kid? Fuck you!",
"Cool it Mark. I'm just trying to help you. I know you're having an affair with Lisa. Am I wrong?",
"Wake up man. Wake up",
"What are you doing? Are you crazy?",
"Don't worry about it. Let's just talk about your problem. (PETER TAKES HIS SHIRT OFF AND WIPES HIS FACE WITH IT.)",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Are you sure you're okay?",
"Why do you want to know my secret? Well, you're right, it's Lisa. I don't know what to do . I'm so depressed. I think I'll kill myself. Johnny is my best friend. She's so manipulative.",
"How did this happen? If Johnny finds out that will be the end of your friendship. What were you thinking? Look, life is very complex, but you have to face it. You should have to be responsible. My advice to you is that you should stop thinking about her, and never do sex with her. Find another girl. That's my advice. Lisa's a sociopath. She only cares about herself, and she's incapable of loving anyone.",
"Whatever Peter. Let's go.",
"Oh thank you. Thanks a lot.",
"Oh hi Billy. That was some funeral wasn't it.",
"Yeah, I'm just glad it's over.",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Billy, we had to make sure Jimmy was really dead. Now that we all saw him lain down in that funeral casket we can be sure he'll never trouble you ever again for his money.",
"There's just some things I don't understand Johnny.",
"Like what? Death? The meaning of life? Love?",
"No, I mean what happened at the police station. Didn't you take Jimmy straight there? It's all very strange.",
"Well you know, the police have to deal with all sorts of crazy people. So, sometimes at the station the police have to do what may seem to us like some strange things.",
"But they said all his blood was sucked out of his body.",
"Some very .... strange things.",
"Hey Peter, come in.",
"It's too bad about Jimmy. I know he was a bad guy, but that was just crazy. Besides, funerals are so depressing.",
"Hey that's life. Have a seat Peter.",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Wow!",
"Wow!",
"Hey guys. You like it?",
"You look great. You look like babyface.",
"What's the occasion Mark?",
"What did you think of the funeral Mark? We were looking for you.",
"What funeral?",
"Okay Hey, you guys want to play some catch the football?",
"In tuxes, you gotta be kidding?",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Come on Mark, let's do it.",
"Johnny?",
"Ask Mr. Glasses-Head over there.",
"Come on Peter .",
"No, I don't think so.",
"Please?? Come on. CHIP!!!!!",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Catch Johnny! Nice snag! All right Peter! Here we go Mark! Come on !",
"Catch Mark.",
"Go , go . . .",
"Gee Mark, why don't you try NOT hurting someone for a change.",
"It's not his fault. It's those damn drugs!",
"Come on, let's go see a doctor.",
"Bye Lisa.",

"Hello mom. How",
"There it us again.",
"What are you talking about?",
"That clicking noise. The phone's been making a strange sound lately .",
"You should report it to the phone company. Utilities are very expensive these days. Did you call a repair technician?",
"No, I think I'll just by a new phone. There's a Radio-Shack nearby .",
"Well, as long as Johnny's paying for it. So, how are you?",
"Why not?",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Oh, I don’t want to get married. I love Mark. Don't you understand that?",
"It's not right Lisa. You should still keep Johnny because he's very independent, and you ain't. Think about the money.",
"Yeah, but I'm not happy anymore. Before I met Mark I didn't think he would blow my mind.",
"What are you talking about? You weren't meant to be happy. I haven't been happy since I got married for the first time. I didn't want to marry your dad either. I've been miserable since then. It's true, men are all assholes. You have to use them and abuse them. There's nothing wrong with that.",
"Well, then you should be happy.",
"But, I don't love him.",
"Don't throw your life away just because you don't love him. That's ridiculous. You've got to grow up and listen to me.",
"Okay, I'll see you at the party then.",
"Bye .",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",
"Hi, can I have a hot chocolate please?",
"Oh hi Johnny! I didn't know it was you. What size would you like?",
"Medium.",
"Sure .",
"Medium also?",
"Whatever floats your boat.",
"Go sit down. We'll be right there.",
"Man, I'm so tired of girl's games.",
"Copyright ©, 1999 Copyright ©, 2001-15 Copyright ©, 2000 ALL RIGHT RESERVED",

"You don't understand anything. Leave your stupid comments in your pocket.",
"Excuse me? 'MY' stupid comments!? Here's some words of wisdom for YOU, you comment making idiot. You think your opinions are so important and that you possess some natural-born expertise. But take it from ME, a REAL expert, when I say that your comments are even more stupider than you, the very person making them. Now, I have a lot of experience, so when I say something, it counts. That's because I'm very important and I know what I'm talking about, unlike feeble-minded you.",

"This is just getting worse and worse.",
"Me too. There's no simple solution to this.",
"Don't worry. You guys worry entirely too much about me.",
"Lisa, we're not worried about you, we are worried about Johnny. You don't understand the psychological impact of what you are doing here. You're hurting yourself, you are hurting OUR friendship.",
